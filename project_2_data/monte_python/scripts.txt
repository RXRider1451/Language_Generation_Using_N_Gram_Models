<Direction: A seashore. Some way out to sea a ragged man is struggling his way to shore. Slowly and with difficulty he makes his way up onto the beach, flops down exhausted and announces:> 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Monty Python's Flying Circus. 

<Direction: Titles beginning with words "Monty Python's Flying Circus". Various bizarre things happen. When titles end: Ordinary grey-suited announcer standing by desk. He smiles confidently.> 

Announcer(Graham Chapman): Good evening. 

<Direction: The announcer confidently moves to chair and sits down. There is a squeal as of a pig being sat upon. Cut to a blackboard with several lines of pigs drawn on it in colour. A man steps into view and with a piece of chalk crosses out one of the pigs CAPTION: 'IT'S WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART' Mozart sitting at piano tinkling with the keys. He finishes tinkling.> 

Mozart(John Cleese): Hello again, and welcome to the show. Tonight we continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with the wonderful death of Genghis Khan, conqueror of India. Take it away Genghis. 

<Direction: Cut to Genghis Khan's tent. Genghis strides about purposefully. Indian-style background music. Suddenly the music cuts out and Genghis Khan with a squawk throws himself in the air and lands on his back. This happens very suddenly. Judges hold up cards with points on, in the manner of ice skating judges.> 

Voice Over(Graham Chapman): 9.1, 9.3, 9.7, that's 28.1 for Genghis Khan. 

<Direction: Mozart still at piano.> 

Mozart(John Cleese): Bad luck Genghis. Nice to have you on the show. And now here are the scores. 

<Direction: Scoreboard with Eddie Waring figure standing by it. The scoreboard looks a little like this: St Stephan 29.9 Richard III 29.3 Jean D'arc 29.1 Marat 29.0 A. Lincoln (U.S of A)  28.2 G. Khan 28.1 King Edward VII 3.1 > 

Eddie(Eric Idle): Well there you can see the scores now. St Stephen in the lead there with his stoning, then comes King Richard the Third at Bosworth Field, a grand death that, then the very lovely Jean d'Arc, then Marat in his bath - best of friends with Charlotte in the showers afterwards - then A. Lincoln of the U.S of A, a grand little chap that, and number six Genghis Khan, and the back marker King Edward the Seventh. Back to you, Wolfgang. 

Mozart(John Cleese): Thank you, Eddie. And now time for this week's request death. 

<Direction: taking card off piano> 

Mozart(John Cleese): For Mr and Mrs Violet Stebbings of 23 Wolverston Road, Hull, the death of Mr Bruce Foster of Guildford. 

<Direction: Cut to a lounge setting. Mr Foster sitting in chair.> 

Foster(Graham Chapman): Strewth! 

<Direction: he dies Mozart still there. He looks at watch.> 

Mozart(John Cleese): Oh blimey, how time flies. Sadly we are reaching the end of yet another programme and so it is finale time. We are proud to be bringing to you one of the evergreen bucket kickers. Yes, the wonderful death of the famous English Admiral Nelson. 

<Direction: Cut to a modern office block, as high as possible. After a pause a body flies out of the top window looking as much like Nelson as possible. As it plummets there is a strangled scream. Kiss me Hardy! The body hits the ground. There is the loud noise of a pig squealing.> 

None(None): Cut to a night school Teacher looking down out of classroom window. He crosses to a long wall blackboard with line of pigs drawn on near end. He crosses one off, walks along blackboard to other end which has written on it 'evening classes 7-8 p.m.'. He writes 'Italian' below this and turns to camera. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome to the second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, and we learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of you can remember what it was? 

<Direction: Shout of 'Si! Si! Si!' from the class whom we see are all Italians.> 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Not all at once ... sit down Mario. Giuseppe! 

Giuseppe(Michael Palin): Il cucchiaio. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would say: 'Molto bene, Giuseppe'. 

Giuseppe(Michael Palin): Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Well, now, this week we're going to learn some useful phrases to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now first of all try telling him where you come from. For example, I would say: 'Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we all try that together? 

All(None): Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Not too bad, now let's try it with somebody else. Er... Mr... ? 

Mariolini(John Cleese): Mariolini. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Ah, Mr Mariolini, and where are you from? 

Mariolini(John Cleese): Napoli, signor. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Ah ... you're an Italian. 

Mariolini(John Cleese): Si, si signor! 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Well in that case you would say: 'Sono Italiano di Napoli'. 

Mariolini(John Cleese): Ah, capisco, mile grazie signor... 

Francesco(Eric Idle): Per favore, signor! 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Yes? 

Francesco(Eric Idle): Non conosgeve parliamente, signor devo me parlo sono Italiano di Napoli quando il habitare de Milano. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): I'm sorry ... I don't understand! 

<Direction: pointing to Francesco> 

Giuseppe(Michael Palin): My friend say 'Why must he say...' 

<Direction: Hand goes up at back of room and a Lederhosen Teutonic figure stands up.> 

German(Graham Chapman): Bitte mein Herr. Was ist das Won fÃ¼r Mittelschmerz? 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Ah! Helmut - you want the German classes. 

German(Graham Chapman): Oh ja! Danke schÃ¶n. 

<Direction: he starts to leave he leaves> 

Giuseppe(Michael Palin): My friend he say, 'Why must I say I am Italian from Napoli when he lives in Milan?' 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Ah, I... well, tell your friend ... if he lives in Milan he must say 'Sono Italiano di Milano...' 

<Direction: agitatedly, leaping to his feet> 

Francesco(Eric Idle): Eeeeeee! Milano Ã¨ tanto meglio di Napoli. Milano Ã¨ la citta la piÃ¹ bella di tutti ... nel mondo... 

Giuseppe(Michael Palin): He say 'Milan is better than Napoli'. 

Teacher(Terry Jones): Oh, he shouldn't be saying that, we haven't done comparatives yet. 

<Direction: In the background everyone has started talking in agitated Italian. At this point a genuine mandolin-playing Italian secreted amongst the cast strikes up: 'Quando Caliente Del Sol...' or similar. The class is out of control by this time. The teacher helplessly tries to control then but eventually gives up and retreats to his desk and sits down. There is a loud pig squeal and he leaps up. ANIMATION: The Blackboard with the coloured pigs drawn on it, is reproduced on the first few frames of the animation film. A real hand comes into the picture and crosses off a third pig. Thereafter action follows the dictates of SeÃ±or Gilliam's wonderfully visual mind.> 

None(None): At the end of this animation we have an advertisement for Whizzo butter. 

<Direction: on animation> 

Voice Over(Terry Gilliam): Yes, mothers, new improved Whizzo butter containing 10% more or less is absolutely indistinguishable from a dead crab. Remember, buy Whizzo butter and go to HEAVEN! 

<Direction: Cut to a group middle-aged lower-middle-class women (hereinafter referred to as 'Pepperpots') being interviewed.> 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): I can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and this dead crab. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Yes, you know, we find that nine out of ten British housewives can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and a dead crab. 

Pepperpots(None): It's true, we can't. No. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Here. Here! You're on television, aren't you? 

<Direction: modestly> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Yes, yes. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): He does the thing with one of those silly women who can't tell Whizzo butter from a dead crab. 

Third Pepperpot(Terry Jones): You try that around here, young man, and we'll slit your face. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'IT'S THE ARTS' 

<Direction: Linkman sitting at desk> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'It's the Arts'. And we kick off this evening with the cinema. 

<Direction: Cut to second interviewer an Ross.> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Good evening. One of the most prolific film directors of this age, or indeed of any age, is Sir Edward Ross, back in his native country for the first time for five years to open a season of his works at the National Film Theatre, and we are very fortunate to have him with us in this studio this evening. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Good evening. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Edward... you don't mind if I call you Edward? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No, not at all. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Only it does worry some people - I don't know why...but they are a little sensitive so I take the precaution of asking on these occasions. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No, no, no that's fine. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): So Edward's all right. Splendid. Splendid. I'm sorry to have brought it up, only eh... 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No, no, please. Edward it is. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Well thank you very much for being so helpful...only it's more than my job's worth to...er... 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Quite, yes. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Makes it rather difficult to establish a rapport ... to put the other person at his ease... 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Quite. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes, silly little point but it does seem to matter. Still - less said the better. Uh...Ted...when you first started in...you don't mind if I call you Ted? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No, no, no everyone calls me Ted. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Well it's shorter, isn't it. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Yes it is. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes, and much less formal! 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Yes, Ted, Edward, anything! 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Splendid, splendid. Incidentally, do call me Tom, I don't want you playing around with any of this 'Thomas' nonsense! Ha ha ha ha! Now where were we? Ah yes. Eddie-baby, when you first started in the... 

Ross(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't like being called 'Eddie-baby'. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): I'm sorry? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): I don't like being called 'Eddie-baby'. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Did I call you 'Eddie-baby'? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Yes, you did! Now get on with it. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): I don't think I did call you Eddie-baby. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): You did call me Eddie-baby. 

<Direction: looking off-screen> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Did I call him Eddie-baby? 

Voices(None): Yes. No. Yes. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): I didn't really call you Eddie-baby, did I, sweetie? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Don't call me sweetie!! 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Can I call you sugar plum? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No! 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Pussy cat? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Angel-drawers? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No you may not! Now get on with it! 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Can I call you 'Frank'? 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Why Frank? 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): It's a nice name. Robin Day's got a hedgehog called Frank. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): What is going on? 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Frannie, little Frannie, Frannie Knickers... 

<Direction: Getting up> 

Ross(Graham Chapman): No. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm off... 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Tell us about your latest film, Sir Edward. 

<Direction: Off-screen> 

Ross(Graham Chapman): What? 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Tell us about your latest film, if you'd be so very kind, Sir Edward. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): None of this 'pussy cat' nonsense? 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Promise. 

<Direction: Pats seat> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Please, Sir Edward. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): My latest film? 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes, Sir Edward. 

Ross(Graham Chapman): Well the idea, funnily enough, came from an idea I had when I first joined the industry in 1919. Of course, in those days I was only the tea boy. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Oh, 

Second Interviewer(None): shut 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): up. 

<Direction: Cut to linkman, as before> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Sir Edward...Ross. Now, later in the programme we will be bringing you a unique event in the world of modern art. Pablo Picasso will be doing a special painting for us, on this programme, live, on a bicycle. But right now it's time to look at a man whose meteoric rise to fame... 

<Direction: A pig squeals. Interviewer leaps up, grabs a revolver from his desk drawer and fires off-screen. CAPTION: 'PIGS 3, NELSON 1' Third Interviewer and Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. Musical score blow-up behind.> 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Last week the Royal Festival Hall saw the first performance of a new symphony by one of the world's leading modern composers, Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. Mr Jackson. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Good evening. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): May I just sidetrack for one moment. Mr. Jackson, this, what shall I call it, nickname of yours. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Ah yes. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): 'Two sheds'. How did you come by it? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Well, I don't use it myself, it's just a few of my friends call me 'Two Sheds'. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I see, and do you in fact have two sheds? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): No. No, I've only one shed. I've had one for some time, but a few years ago I said I was thinking of getting another one, and since then some people have called me 'Two Sheds'. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): In spite of the fact that you only have one. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Yes. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I see, and are you thinking of purchasing a second shed? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): No! 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): To bring you in line with your epithet? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): No. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I see, I see. Well let's return to your symphony. Ah, now then, did you write this symphony... 

Third Interviewer(None): in 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): the shed? 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Have you written any of your recent works in this shed of yours? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): No it's just a perfectly ordinary garden shed. 

<Direction: A picture of a shed appears on the screen behind them.> 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I see. And you're thinking of buying this second shed to write in. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): No, no. Look. This shed business, it doesn't really matter at all, the sheds aren't important. It's just a few friends call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it. I wish you'd ask me about my music. I'm a composer. People always ask me about the sheds, they've got it out of proportion, I'm fed up with the shed, I wish I'd never got it in the first place. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I expect you are probably thinking of selling one. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): I will sell one. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Then you'll be Arthur 'No Sheds' Jackson? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Look, forget about the sheds. They don't matter. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Mr. Jackson, I think, with respect, we ought to talk about your symphony. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): What? 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Apparently your symphony was written for organ and tympani. 

<Direction: catches sight of the picture of the shed behind hin> 

Jackson(Terry Jones): What's that? 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): What's what? 

Jackson(Terry Jones): It's a shed. Get it off. 

<Direction: He points to BP screen shed. The picture of the shed disappears and is replaced by a picture of Jackson. Jackson looks at it carefully.> 

Jackson(Terry Jones): Right. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Now then Mr. Jackson...your symphony. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'ARTHUR "TWO SHEDS" JACKSON' 

<Direction: Cut back to studio: the picture of him is replaced by a picture of two sheds, one with a question mark over it.> 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I understand that you used to be interested in train-spotting. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): I understand that, about thirty years ago, you were extremely interested in train-spotting. 

Jackson(Terry Jones): What's that got to do with my bloody music? 

<Direction: Enter Second Interviewer from Edward Ross sketch (John)> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Are you having any trouble from him? 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Yes, a little. 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Exactly. Well we interviewers are more than a match for the likes of you, 'Two Sheds'. 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Yes, make yourself scarce, 'Two Sheds'. This studio isn't big enough for the three of us! 

<Direction: They push him away and propel him out.> 

Jackson(Terry Jones): What are you doing? 

<Direction: he is pushed out of vision with a crash> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Get your own Arts programme, you fairy! 

<Direction: to camera> 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. 

<Direction: Cut to linkman. He is about to speak when: off-screen> 

Third Interviewer(Eric Idle): Never mind, Timmy. 

<Direction: off-screen> 

Second Interviewer(John Cleese): Oh, Michael, you are such a comfort. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Arthur 'Two Sheds'... 

<Direction: Cut to a man in Viking helmet at desk.> 

Viking(John Cleese): ...Jackson. 

<Direction: Cut back to linkman.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): And now for more news of the momentous artistic event in which Pablo Picasso is doing a specially commissioned painting for us whilst riding a bicycle. Pablo Picasso - the founder of modern art - without doubt the greatest abstract painter ever... for the first time painting in motion. But first of all let's have a look at the route he'll be taking. 

<Direction: Cut to Raymond Baxter type standing in front of map. A small cardboard cut-out of Picasso's face is on map and is moved around to illustrate route.> 

Baxter(Michael Palin): Well Picasso will be starting, David, at Chichester here, he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell, he'll then take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well, this is a truly remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of such stature has taken the A272, and it'll be very interesting to see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green. Vicky. 

<Direction: Cut to Vicky, holding a bicycle.> 

Vicky(Eric Idle): Well Picasso will be riding his Viking Super Roadster with the drop handlebars and the dual-thread wheel-rims and with his Wiley-Prat 20-1 synchro-mesh he should experience difficulties on the sort of road surfaces they just don't get abroad. Mitzie. 

<Direction: Cut to linkman at desk with Viking on one side and a knight in armour on the other.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): And now for the latest report on Picasso's progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by-pass. 

<Direction: Reg Moss standing with hand mike by fairly busy road.> 

Reg Moss(Eric Idle): Well there's no sign of Picasso at the moment, David. But he should be through here at any moment. However I do have with me Mr Ron Geppo, British Cycling Sprint Champion and this year's winner of the Derby-Doncaster rally. 

<Direction: Geppo is in full cyclist's kit.> 

Geppo(Graham Chapman): Well Reg, I think Pablo should be all right provided he doesn't attempt anything on the monumental scale of some of his earlier paintings, like Guernica or Mademoiselles d'Avignon or even his later War and Peace murals for the Temple of Peace chapel at Vallauris, because with this strong head wind I don't think even Doug Timpson of Manchester Harriers could paint anything on that kind of scale. 

Reg Moss(Eric Idle): Well, thank you Ron. Well, there still seems to be no sign of Picasso, so I'll hand you back to the studio. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Well, we've just heard that Picasso is approaching the Tolworth roundabout on the A3 so come in Sam Trench at Tolworth. 

<Direction: Cut to Sam Trench at roadside.> 

Trench(John Cleese): Well something certainly is happening here at Tolworth roundabout, David. I can now see Picasso, he's cycling down very hard towards the roundabout, he's about 75-50 yards away and I can now see his painting... it's an abstract... I can see some blue some purple and some little black oval shapes... I think I can see... 

<Direction: A Pepperpot comes up and nudges him.> 

Pepperpot(Michael Palin): That's not Picasso - that's Kandinsky. 

<Direction: excited cylists pass in front of him> 

Trench(John Cleese): Piet Mondrian - just behind, Piet Mondrian the Neo-Plasticist, and then a gap, then the main bunch, here they come, Chagall, Max Ernst, Miro, Dufy, Ben Nicholson, Jackson Pollock and Bernard Buffet making a break on the outside here, Brancusi's going with him, so is Gericault, Ferdinand Leger, Delaunay, De Kooning, Kokoschka's dropping back here by the look of it, and so's Paul Klee dropping back a bit and, right at the back of this group, our very own Kurt Schwitters.. 

Pepperpot(Michael Palin): He's German! 

Trench(John Cleese): But as yet absolutely no sign of Pablo Picasso, and so from Tolworth roundabout back to the studio. 

<Direction: Toulouse-Lautrec pedals past on a child's tricycle. Cut back to studio.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Well I think I can help you there Sam, we're getting reports in from the AA that Picasso, Picasso has fallen off...he's fallen off his bicycle on the B2127 just outside Ewhurst, trying to get a short cut through to Dorking via Gomslake and Peashall. Well, Picasso is reported to be unhurt, but the pig has a slight headache. And on that note we must say goodnight to you. Picasso has failed in his first bid for international cycling fame. So from all of us here at the 'It's the Arts' studio, it's goodnight. Goodnight.

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: Cartoon sequence of animated Victorian photos, at the end of which a large pig descends, fatally, on a portrait of a man. Cut to wartime planning room. Two officers are pushing model pigs across the map. A private enters and salutes.> 

Private(Terry Jones): Dobson's bought it, sir. 

Officer(Michael Palin): Porker, eh? Swine. 

<Direction: Cut to a suburban house in a rather drab street. Zoom into upstairs window. Seriuos documentary music. Interior of a small room. A bent figure (Michael) huddles over a table, writing. He is surrounded by bits of paper. The camera is situated facing the man as he writes with immense concentration lining his unshaven face.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): This man is Ernest Scribbler... writer of jokes. In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in the world... and, as a consequence, he will die ... laughing. 

<Direction: Ernest stops writing, pauses to look at what he has written... a smile slowly spreads across his face, turning very, very slowly to uncontrolled hysterical laughter... he staggers to his feet and reels across room helpless with mounting mirth and eventually collapses and dies on the floor.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): It was obvious that this joke was lethal... no one could read it and live ... 

<Direction: The scribbler's mother (Eric) enters. She sees him dead, she gives a little cry of horror and bends over his body, weeping. Brokenly she notices the piece of paper in his hand and (thinking it is a suicide note - for he has not been doing well for the last thirteen years) picks it up and reads it between her sobs. Immediately she breaks out into hysterical laughter, leaps three feet into the air, and falls down dead without more ado. Cut to news type shot of commentator standing in front of the house. reverentially> 

Commentator(Terry Jones): This morning, shortly after eleven o'clock, comedy struck this little house in Dibley Road. Sudden ...violent ... comedy. Police have sealed off the area, and Scotland Yard's crack inspector is with me now. 

Inspector(Graham Chapman): I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke. 

<Direction: At this point an upstairs window in the house is flung open and a doctor, with stetoscope, rears his head out, hysterical with laughter, and dies hanging over the window sill. The commentator and the inspector look up briefly and sadly, and then continue as if they are used to such sights this morning.> 

Inspector(Graham Chapman): I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ... 

<Direction: he indicates a little knot of dour-looking policemen standing nearby> 

Inspector(Graham Chapman): The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke. 

<Direction: He gives a signal. The group of policemen start groaning and chanting biblical laments. The Dead March is heard. The inspector squares his shoulders and bravely starts walking into the house.> 

Commentator(Terry Jones): There goes a brave man. Whether he comes out alive or not, this will surely be remembered as one of the most courageous and gallant acts in police history. 

<Direction: The inspector suddenly appears at the door, helpless with laughter, holding the joke aloft. He collapses and dies. Cut to film of army vans driving along dark roads.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): It was not long before the Army became interested in the military potential of the Killer Joke. Under top security, the joke was hurried to a meeting of Allied Commanders at the Ministry of War. 

<Direction: Cut to door at Ham House: Soldier on guard comes to attention as dispatch rider hurries in carrying armoured box. Notice on door: 'Conference. No Admittance'. Cut to a pillbox on the Salisbury Plain. Track in to slit to see moustachioed top brass peering anxiously out.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Top brass were impressed. Tests on Salisbury Plain confirmed the joke's devastating effectiveness at a range of up to fifty yards. 

<Direction: Cut to shot looking out of slit in pillbox. Zoom through slit to distance where a solitary figure is standing on the windswept plain. He is a bespectacled, weedy lance-corporal Terry Jones Cut in to corporal's face - registening complete lack of comprehension as well as stupidity. Man on top of pillbox waves flag. The soldiers reveal the joke to the corporal. He peers at it, thinks about its meaning, sniggers, and dies. Two watching generals are very impressed. Fantastic. Cut to a Colonel talking to camera.> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): All through the winter of '43 we had translators working, in joke-proof conditions, to try and produce a German version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several weeks in hospital. But apart from that things went pretty quickly, and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops couldn't understand but which the Germans could. 

<Direction: Cut to a trench in the Ardennes. Members of the joke brigade are crouched holding pieces of paper with the joke on them.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): So, on July 8th, 1944, the joke was first told to the enemy in the Ardennes... 

Commanding NCO(None): Tell the ... joke. 

<Direction: together Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ...      Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput! Pan out of the British trench across war-torn landscape and come to rest where      presumably the German trench is. There is a pause and then a group of Germans      rear up in hysterics.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): It was a fantastic success. Over sixty thousand times as powerful as      Britain's great pre-war joke ... 

<Direction: Cut to a film of Chamberlain brandishing the 'Peace in our time' bit of paper.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): ...and one which Hitler just couldn't match. 

<Direction: Film of Hitler rally. Hitler speaks; subtitles are superimposed. SUBTITLE 'MY DOG'S GOT NO NOSE' A young soldier responds: SUBTITLE: HOW DOES HE SMELL? Hitler speaks: SUBTITLE: AWFUL'> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): In action it was deadly. 

<Direction: Cut to a small squad with rifles making their way through forest. Suddenly one of      them (a member of the joke squad) sees something and gives signal at which they all dive for cover. From the cover of a tree he reads out joke.> 

Joke Corporal(Terry Jones): Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! .. Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput! 

<Direction: Sniper falls laughing out of tree. charging Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput. They chant the joke. Germans are put to flight laughing, some dropping to ground.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): The German casualties were appalling. 

<Direction: Cut to a German hospital and a ward full of casualties still laughing hysterically. Cut to Nazi interrogation room. An officer from the joke brigade has a light shining in his face. A Gestapo officer is interrogating him; another (clearly labelled 'A Gestapo Officer') stands behind him.> 

Nazi(John Cleese): Vott is the big joke? 

Officer(Michael Palin): I can only give you name, rank, and why did the chicken cross the road? 

Nazi(John Cleese): That's not funny! 

<Direction: slaps him> 

Nazi(John Cleese): I vant to know the joke. 

Officer(Michael Palin): All right. How do you make a Nazi cross? 

<Direction: momentarily fooled> 

Nazi(John Cleese): I don't know ... how do you make a Nazi cross? 

Officer(Michael Palin): Tread on his corns. 

<Direction: does so; the Nazi hops in pain> 

Nazi(John Cleese): Gott in Himmel! That's not funny! 

<Direction: mimes cuffing him while the other Nazi claps his hands to provide the sound effct> 

Nazi(John Cleese): Now if you don't tell me the joke, I shall hit you properly. 

Officer(Michael Palin): I can stand physical pain, you know. 

Nazi(John Cleese): Ah ... you're no fun. All right, Otto. 

<Direction: Otto (Graham) starts tickling the officer who starts laughing.> 

Officer(Michael Palin): Oh no - anything but that please no, all right I'll tell you.

Commentator(Eric Idle): In 1945 Peace broke out. It was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare was banned at a special session of the Geneva Convention, and in 1950 the last remaining copy of the joke was laid to rest here in the Berkshire countryside, never to be told again.

City Gent(Terry Jones): Good afternoon. 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Afternoon.

City Gent(Terry Jones): sheep aren't they? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Ar. 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Yes, yes of course, I thought so...only...er why are they up in the trees? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): A fair question and one that in recent weeks has been much on my mind. It's my considered opinion that they're nesting. 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Nesting? 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Like birds? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Ar. Exactly. Birds is the key to the whole problem. It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds. Observe their behavior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op about the field on their back legs. 

<Direction: off-screen baa-ing sound of sheep plummeting baaaaaa...thump> 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Talk about the blind leading the blind. 

City Gent(Terry Jones): But why do they think they're birds? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Another fair question. One thing is for sure; a sheep is not a creature of the air. They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'. 

<Direction: crash> 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): As you see. As for flight, its body is totally unadapted to the problems of aviation. Trouble is, sheep are very dim. Once they get an idea in their heads, there's no shifting it. 

City Gent(Terry Jones): But where did they get the idea from? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): From Harold. He's that sheep there over under the elm. He's that most dangerous of animals, a clever sheep. He's the ring-leader. He has realized that a sheep's life consists of standing around for a few months and then being eaten. And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep. He's patently hit on the idea of escape. 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Well why don't you just get rid of Harold? 

Rustic(Graham Chapman): Because of the enormous commercial possibilities should he succeed. 

<Direction: Two Frenchmen stand in front of a diagram of a sheep adapted for flying. They speak rapidly in French, much of it pseudo.>

Second Pepperpot(Terry Jones): Blaise Pascal. 

Third Pepperpot(Michael Palin): Jean-Paul Sartre. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Yes, Voltaire. 

Second Pepperpot(Terry Jones): Ooh! - RenÃ© Descartes. 

<Direction: RenÃ© Descartes is sitting thinking. Bubbles come from his head with 'thinks'. Suddenly he looks happy. In thought bubble appears 'I THINK THEREFORE I AM'. A large hand comes into the picture with a pin and pricks the thought bubble. It deflates and disappears. After a second RenÃ© disappears too.

<Direction: seeing a camera moving round behind him> 

Frampton(Terry Jones): Here? What's that camera doing? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, nothing, nothing at all, sir. We were wondering if you could see your way clear...to giving us...a quick... a quick... visual... Mr Frampton, will you take your trousers down? 

<Direction: slapping away a hand from off-screen> 

Frampton(Terry Jones): 'Ere, get off! I'm not taking me trousers down on television. Who do you think I am? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Please take them down. 

Frampton(Terry Jones): No. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Just a little bit. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): No, er ahem... 

<Direction: firmly> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Now look here Mr Frampton... It's perfectly easy for somebody just to come along here to the BBC simply claiming... that they have a bit to spare in the botty department...but the point is Mr. Frampton... our viewers need proof.

Frampton(Terry Jones): Er...yes. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well why didn't you 

Interviewer(None): say 

Interviewer(John Cleese): so? 

Frampton(Terry Jones): I thought it was the continental version.

No, only kidding. Ha, ha, ha. Seriously now, ladies and gentlemen, we have for you one of the most unique acts in the world today. He's...well I'll say no more, just let you see for yourselves...ladies and gentlemen, my very great priviledge to introduve Arthur Ewing, and his musical mice. 

<Direction: Cut to Ewing> 

Ewing(Terry Jones): Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. I have in this box twenty-three white mice. Mice which have been painstakingly trained over the past few years, to squeak at a selected pitch. 

<Direction: he raises a mouse by its tail> 

Ewing(Terry Jones): This is E sharp... and this one is G. You get the general idea. Noe these mice are so arranged upon this rack, that when played in the correct order they will squeak 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you on the mouse organ 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Thank you. 

<Direction: He produces two mallets. He starts striking the mice while singing quietly 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Each downward stroke of the mallet brings a terribly squashing sound and the expiring squeak. It is quite clear that he is slaughtering the mice. The musical effect is poor. After the first few notes people are shouting 'Stop it, stop him someone, Oh my God'. He cheerfully takes a bow. He is hauled off by the floor manager.>

Counsellor(Eric Idle): Deirdre. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful, beautiful name 

<Direction: leans across and lightly brushes his hand accross the wife's cheek> 

Counsellor(Eric Idle): And what seems to be the trouble with your marriage Mr Pewtey? 

Man(Michael Palin): Well, it all started about five years ago when we started going on holiday to Brighton together. Deirdre, that's my wife, has always been a jolly good companion to me and I never particularly anticipated any marital strife - indeed the very idea of consulting a professional marital adviser has always been of the greatest repugnance to me although far be it from me to impugn the nature of your trade or profession 

<Direction: The counsellor and wife are not listening, fascinated by each other. realizing Pewtey has stopped> 

Counsellor(Eric Idle): Do go on. 

Man(Michael Palin): Well, as I say, we've always been good friends, sharing the interests, the gardening and so on, the model aeroplanes, the sixpenny bottle for the holiday money, and indeed twice a month settling down in the evenings doing the accounts, something which, er, Deirdre, Deirdre that's my wife, er, particularly looked forward to on account of her feet 

<Direction: the counsellor has his face fantastically close to the wife's, as close that they could get without kissing> 

Man(Michael Palin): I should probably have said at the outset that I'm noted for having something of a sense of humour, although I have kept myself very much to myself over the last two years notwithstanding, as it were, and it's only as comparatively recently that I began to realize - well, er prehaps realize is not the correct word, er, imagine, imagine, that I was not the only thing in her life 

<Direction: who is practically in a clinch with her> 

Counsellor(Eric Idle): You suspected your wife? 

Man(Michael Palin): Well yes - at first, frankly yes 

<Direction: the counsellor points the wife to a screen; she goes behind it> 

Man(Michael Palin): Her behaviour did seem at the time to me, who after all was there to see, to be a little odd. 

Counsellor(Eric Idle): Odd? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes well, I mean to a certain extent yes. I'm not by nature a suspicious person - far from it - though in fact I have something of a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, if you take my meaning.... 

<Direction: A piece of his wife's clothing comes over the top of the screen.> 

Counsellor(Eric Idle): Yes I certainly do 

<Direction: The wife's bra and panties come over the screen.>

<Direction: the cousellor has already gone behind the screen> 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, well that's p'raps the best things. Yes. You've certainly put my mind at rest on one or two points, there. 

<Direction: Exits through door. He is stopped by a deep southern American voice.> 

Southener(John Cleese): Now wait there stranger. A man can run and run for year after year until he realizes      that what he's running from...is hisself 

Man(Michael Palin): Gosh. 

Southener(John Cleese): A man's got to do what a man's got to do, and there ain't no sense in runnin'. Now      you gotta turn, and you gotta fight, and you gotta hold your head up high. 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes! 

Southener(John Cleese): Now you go back in there my son and be a man. Walk tall. 

<Direction: he exits> 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, I will. I will. I've been pushed around long enough. This is it. This is your monent Arthur Pewtey - this is it Arthur Pewtey. At last you're a man!

Man(John Cleese): Well... I was about seventeen and some mates and me went to a party, and, er...      we had quite a lot to drink... and then some of the fellows there ... started handing ... cheese      around ... and well just out of curiosity I tried a bit ... and well that was that. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): And what else did these fellows do? 

Man(John Cleese): Well some of them started dressing up as mice a bit ... and then when they'd got      the costumes on they started ... squeaking. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Yes. And was that all? 

Man(John Cleese): That was all. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): And what was your reaction to this? 

Man(John Cleese): Well I was shocked. But, er... gradually I came to feel that I was more at ease ... with other mice.

Linkman(Michael Palin): What is it that attracts someone like mr. A to this way of life? I have with me a consultant psychiatrist. 

<Direction: The camera pulls back to reveal the psychiatrist who places in front og himself a notice saying 'The Amazing Kargol And Janet'.> 

Kargol(Graham Chapman): Well, we've just heard a typical case history. I myself have over seven hundred similar histories, all fully documented. Would you care to choose one? 

<Direction: Janet (Carol), dressed in a showgirl's outfit, enters and offers linkman the case histories fanned out like cards, with one more prominent than the others; he picks it out. without looking> 

Kargol(Graham Chapman): Mr Arthur Aldridge of Leamington. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Well, that's amazing, amazing. Thank you, Janet. 

<Direction: chord; Janet postures and exits> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Kargol, speaking as a psychiatrist as opposed to a conjuror... 

<Direction: disappointed> 

Kargol(Graham Chapman): Oh... 

Linkman(Michael Palin): ...what makes certain men want to be mice? 

Kargol(Graham Chapman): Well, we psychiatrist have found that over 8% of the population will always be mice, I mean, after all, there's something of the mouse in all of us. I mean, how many of us can honestly say that at one time or another he hasn't felt sexually attracted to mice. 

<Direction: linkman looks puzzeld linkman looks increasingly embarrassed phone on desk rings; the linkman picks it up but does not answer it> 

Kargol(Graham Chapman): The only way to bring the crime figures down is to reduce the number of offences - get it out in the open - I know I have. 

<Direction: replacing phone> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): The Amazing Kargol And Janet.  What a lot of people don't realize is that a mouse, once accepted, can fulfil a very useful role in society. Indeed there are examples throughout history of famous men now known to have been mice.

Accountant(Graham Chapman): Oh well I'm a chartered accountant, and consequently too boring to be of interest. 

Vicar(John Cleese): I feel that these poor unfortunate people should be free to live the lives of their own choice. 

Porter(Terry Jones): I'd split their nostrils open with a boat hook, I think. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Well I mean, they can't help it, can they? But, er, there's nothing you can do about it. So er, I'd kill 'em. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Clearly the British public's view is a hostile one. 

<Direction: 'HOSTILE'> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): But perhaps this is because so little is generally known of these mice men. We have      some film now taken of one of the notorious weekend mouse parties, where these disgusting      little perverts meet. 

<Direction: Cut to exterior house (night). The blinds are drawn so that only shadows of enormous      mice can be seen, holding slices of cheese and squeaking.>

<Direction: Cut to Mr A.> 

Mr A(John Cleese): Well first of all you get shown to your own private hole in the skirting board... then you      put the mouse skin on... then you scurry into the main room, and perhaps take a run in the      wheel. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): The remainder of this film was taken secretly at one of these mouse parties by a      BBC cameraman posing as a vole. As usual we apologize for the poor quality of the film. 

<Direction: Very, poor quality film, shadowy shapes, the odd mouse glimpsed.> 

Mr A's Voice(John Cleese): Well, er, then you steal some cheese, Brie or Camembert, or Cheddar or      Gouda, if you're on the harder stuff. You might go and see one of the blue cheese films...      there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then      ...eventually, it strikes one... and you all run down. 

<Direction: Cut to a large matron with apron and cawing knife.> 

Linkman's Voice(Michael Palin): And what's that? 

Mr A's Voice(John Cleese): That's the farmer's wife. 

<Direction: Cut to the linkman at desk.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Perhaps we need to know more of these mice men before we can really judge      them. Perhaps not. Anyway, our thirty minutes are up. 

<Direction: Sound of baa-ing. The linkman looks up in air, looks startled, pulls a gun from under the      desk and fires in the air. The body of a sheep falls to the floor.>

Prisoner(Eric Idle): Well... I'd just like to say, m'lud, I've got a family... a wife and six kids... and I hope very much you don't have to take away my freedom... because... well, because m'lud freedom is a state much prized within the realm of civilized society. 

<Direction: slips into Olivier impression> 

Prisoner(Eric Idle): It is a bond wherewith the savage man may charm the outward hatchments of his soul, and soothe the troubled breast into a magnitude of quiet. It is most precious as a blessed balm, the saviour of princes, the harbinger of happiness, yea, the very stuff and pith of all we hold most dear. What frees the prisoner in his lonely cell, chained within the bondage of rude walls, far from the owl of Thebes? What fires and stirs the woodcock in his springe or wakes the drowsy apricot betides? What goddess doth the storm toss'd mariner offer her most tempestuous prayers to? Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Well, her sister's gone to Rhodesia what with her womb and all, and her youngest, her youngest as thin as a filing cabinet, and the goldfish, the goldfish they've got whooping cough they keep spitting water all over their Bratbys, well, they do don't they, I mean you can't, can you, I mean they're not even married or anything, they're not even divorced, and he's in the KGB if you ask me, he says he's a tree surgeon but I don't like the sound of his liver, all that squeaking and banging every night till the small hours, his mother's been much better since she had her head off, yes she has, I said, don't you talk to me about bladders, I said... 

<Direction: During all this counsel has been trying to ask questions. Eventually he gives up and Mrs. Lewis is pushed out of court still talking.>

Counsel(John Cleese): No he's not completely dead m'lud. No. But he's not at all well. 

Judge(Terry Jones): But if he's not dead, what's he doing in a coffin? 

Counsel(John Cleese): Oh, it's purely a precaution m'lud - if I may continue? Mr Aldridge, you were a... you are a stockbroker of 10 Savundra Close, Wimbledon. 

<Direction: from the coffin comes a bang> 

Counsel(John Cleese): Mr Aldridge... 

Judge(Terry Jones): What was that knock? 

Counsel(John Cleese): It means 'yes' m'lud. One knock for 'yes', and two knocks for 'no'. If I may continue? Mr Aldridge, would it be fair to say that you are not at all well?

Judge(Terry Jones): Where is all this leading us?

Counsel(John Cleese): No further questions m'lud.

Counsel(John Cleese): There are no easy answers in this case m'lud.

Counsel(John Cleese): M'lud the strange, damnable, almost diabolic threads of this extraordinary tangled web of intrigue will shortly m'lud reveal a plot so fiendish, so infernal, so heinous ... 

Judge(Terry Jones): Mr Bartlett, your client has already pleaded guilty to the parking offence.

Counsel(John Cleese): Er, you are Cardinal Armand du Piessis de Richelieu, First Minister of Louis XIII? 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): Oui. 

Counsel(John Cleese): Cardinal, would it be fair to say that you not only built up the centralized monarchy in France but also perpetuated the religious schism in Europe? 

<Direction: modestly> 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): That's what they say. 

Counsel(John Cleese): Did you persecute the Huguenots? 

Counsel(John Cleese): And did you take even sterner measures against the great Catholic nobles who made common cause with foreign foes in defence of their feudal independence? 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): I sure did that thing. 

Counsel(John Cleese): Cardinal. Are you acquainted with the defendant, Harold Larch? 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): Since I was so high

Cardinal(Michael Palin): Listen. Harry is a very wonderful human being. 

Counsel(John Cleese): M'lud. In view of the impeccable nature of this character witness may I plead for clemency.

Cardinal(Michael Palin): That is correct. 

Dim(Graham Chapman): Ah ha! He fell for my little trap. 

<Direction: Court applauds and the Cardinal looks dismayed.> 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): Curse you Inspector Dim. You are too clever for us naughty people. 

Dim(Graham Chapman): And furthermore I suggest that you are none other than Ron Higgins, professional Cardinal Richelieu impersonator. 

Cardinal(Michael Palin): It's a fair cop. 

Counsel(John Cleese): My you're clever Dim. He'd certainly taken me in. 

Dim(Graham Chapman): It's all in a day's work.

Janet(John Cleese): Put that Baroque masterpiece down!

<Direction: Cut to a gentleman in striped blazer, boater and cricket flannels walking down to beach clutching towel and bathing trunks. He puts his towel on a breakwater next to another towel and starts to change. He suddenly looks up and we see everyone on the beach has turned to watch him - not with any disapproval - just a blank English stare. He grabs his towel off the breakwater and starts to take his trousers off under that. Girl in a bikini has been sitting on other side of the breakwater, stands up looking for her towel. She sees that the man is using it and she whisks it off him leaving him clutching his half-down trousers. Shot of everyone staring at him again. He pulls them up and makes for a beach hut... embarrassed. He goes into beach hut. Inside he is about to take his trousers off, when he becomes aware of a pair of feet which come up to the back of the beach hut - there is a 6-inch gap along bottom - and stop as if someone was peering through the crack. The man looks slightly outraged and pulls his trousers up, goes outside and edges cautiously round to the back of the beach hut. There he finds a man (Michael) bending close to the side of the beach hut with his hand to his face. The Gentleman kicks him hard in the seat of the pants. The man turns in obvious surprise, to reveal he was merely trying to light his cigarette out of the wind. The gentleman backs away with embarrassed apologies. We cut to the front of the beach hut to see gentleman backing round at the same time as a large matronly woman marches into the hut... the man follows her in. He is promptly thrown out on his ear. In desperation he looks around. On the promenade he suddenly sees an ice-cream van. He walks up to it, looks around, then nips behind to start changing. At the same time a policeman (Graham) strolls up to the ice-cream van and tells it to move on. The van drives off, exposing the gentleman clutching his trousers around his ankles. Close-up policeman's reaction. The man hurriedly pulls trousers up as policeman approaches him pulling out note book. Still covered in confusion he runs away from the policeman. In long shot we see him approach the commissionaire of the Royale Palace De Luxe Hotel. He whispers to the commissionaire, indicates by mime that he wants to take his trousers off. The commissionaire reacts to the gesture. The man nods. The commissionaire starts to take his trousers off. Man backs away once more in confusion - he has been misunderstood. Back on the beach again. He hides behind a pile of deckchairs. At that moment a beach party of jolly trippers arrive and each takes one. The deckchair pile rapidly disappears leaving the gentleman once again exposed. He dashes behind the deckchair attendant's hut which is next to him. Enter two workmen who dismantle it. Desperate by now he goes onto the pier. He goes into the amusement arcade, looking around furtively. Nips behind a 'what the butler saw' machine. Woman comes and puts penny in and starts to look, beckons over husband; he comes, looks in the machine, sees the man changing his trousers. They chase him off. Still pursued he nips into door. Finds himself in blackness. Relieved - at last he has found somewhere to change. He relaxes and starts to take his trousers off. Suddenly hears music and applause... curtains swishes back to reveal he is on stage of the pier pavilion. The audience applauds. Resigned to his fate, he breaks into stiptease routine. and CAPTION: 'IT'S A MAN'S LIFE TAKING YOUR CLOTHES OFF IN PUBLIC' Cut to colonel>

<Direction: to patient> 

Arthur(Eric Idle): spit ... by the time I got back from lunch I had every dental surgeon in SW1 waiting for them all in the broom cupboard. Funny isn't it, how naughty dentists always make that one fatal mistake. Bye for now ... keep your teeth clean.

Mrs B(Terry Jones): I'd better go and let him in. 

<Direction: Mrs B goes out and comes back into the room with the Vet. stage whisper> 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): It's the Vet, dear. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Oh very glad indeed you could come round, sir. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Not at all. Now what seems to be the problem? You can tell me - I'm a Vet, you know. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): See! Tell him, dear. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Well... 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): It's our cat. He doesn't do anything. He just sits out there on the lawn. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Is he ... dead? 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Oh, no! 

<Direction: to camera dramaticaly> 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Thank God for that. For one ghastly moment I thought I was... too late. If only more people would call in the nick of time. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): He just sits there, all day and every day. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): And at night. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Sh! Almost motionless. We have to take his food out to him. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): And his milk. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Sh! He doesn't do anything. He just sits there. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Are you at your wits' end? 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Definitely, yes. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Hm. I see. Well I think I may be able to help you. You see ... 

<Direction: he goes over to armchair, puts on spectacles, sits, crosses legs and puts finger tips together> 

Vet(Graham Chapman): ... your cat is suffering from what we Vets haven't found a word for. His condition is typified by total physical inertia, absence of interest in its ambience - what we Vets call environment - failure to respond to the conventional external stimuli - a ball of string, a nice juicy mouse, a bird. To be blunt, your cat is in a rut. It's the old stockbroker syndrome, the suburban fin de siecle ennui, angst, weltschmertz, call it what you will. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Moping. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): In a way, in a way ... hum ... moping, I must remember that. Now, what's to be done? Tell me sir, have you confused your cat recently? 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Well we ... 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Sh! No. 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Yes ... well I think I can definitely say that your cat badly needs to be confused. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): What? 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Sh! What? 

Vet(Graham Chapman): Confused. To shake it out of its state of complacency. I'm afraid I'm not personally qualified to confuse cats, but I can recommend an extremely good service. Here is their card.

Sergeant(Michael Palin): Squad! Eyes front! Stand at ease. Cat confusers ...shun! 

<Direction: From a following car a general alights.> 

General(John Cleese): Well men, we've got a pretty difficult cat to confuse today so let's get straight on with it. Jolly good. Thank you sergeant. 

Sergeant(Michael Palin): Confusers attend to the van and fetch out... wait for it... fetch out the funny things. 

<Direction: the men unload the van> 

Sergeant(Michael Palin): Move, move, move. One, two, one, two, get those funny things off. 

<Direction: The workmen are completing the erection of a proscenium with curtains in front of the still immobile cat. A and B watch with awe. The arrangements are completed. All stand ready.>

My lords, ladies and Gedderbong. Long John Silver disappears. A pause. Two boxers appear. They circle each other. On one's head a bowler hat appears, vanishes. On the other's a sterve-pipe hat appears. On the first's head is a fez. The stove-pipe hat becomes a stetson. The fez becomes a cardinal's hat. The stetson becomes a wimple. Then the cardinal's hat and the wimple vanish. One of the boxers becomes Napoleon and the other boxer is astonished. Napoleon punches the boxer with the hand inside his jacket. The boxer falls, stunned. Horizontally he shoots off stage. Shot of cat, watching unimpressed. Napoleon does one-legged pixilated dance across stage and off, immediately reappearinng on other side of stage doing same dance in same direction. He reaches the other side, but is halted by a traffic policeman. The policeman beckons onto the stage a man in a penguin skin on a pogostick. The penguin gets halfway across and then turns into a dustbin. Napoleon hops off stage. Policeman goes to dustbin, opens it and Napoleon gets out. Shot of cat, still unmoved. A nude man with a towel round his waist gets out of the dustbin. Napoleon points at ground. A chair appears where he points. The nude man gets on to the chair, jumps in the air and vanishes. Then Napoleon points to ground by him and a small cannon appears. Napoleon fires cannon and the policeman disappears. The man with the towel round his waist gets out of the dustbin and is chased off stage by the penguin on the pogostick. A sedan chair is carried on stage by two chefs. The man with the towel gets out and the penguin appears from the dustbin and chases him off. Napoleon points to sedan chair and it changes into dustbin. Man in towel runs back on to stage and jumps in dustbin. He looks out and the penguin appears from the other dustbin and hits him on the head with a raw chicken. Shot of cat still unimpressed. Napoleon, the man with the towel round his waist, the policeman, a boxer, and a chef suddenly appear standing in a line, and take a bow. They immediately change positions and take another bow. The penguin appears at the end of the line with a puff of smoke. Each one in turn jumps in the air and vanishes. Shot of passive cat. Cut to Mr A and Mrs B watching with the general.> 

General(John Cleese): I hope to God it works. Anyway, we shall know any minute now. 

<Direction: After a pause, the cat gets up and walks into the house. Mr A and Mrs B are overcome with joy.> 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): I can't believe it. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): Neither can I. It's just like the old days. 

Mrs B(Terry Jones): Then he's cured. Oh thank you, general. 

Mr A(Michael Palin): What can we ever do to repay you? 

General(John Cleese): No need to, sir. It's all in a day's work for 'Confuse-a-Cat'.

<Direction: an alarm clock goes off inside his case; the Man thumps it, unsuccessfully> 

Officer(John Cleese): Have you got an alarm clock in there, sir? 

Man(Michael Palin): No, no, heavens no, no... just vests.

<Direction: Clocks start ticking and chiming in the case. The man desperately thumps the case.> 

Man(Michael Palin): All right, I confess, I'm a smuggler ... This whole case is crammed full of Swiss watches and clocks. I've been purposely trying to deceive Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I've been a bloody fool. 

Officer(John Cleese): I don't believe you, sir. 

Man(Michael Palin): It's true. I'm, er, guilty of smuggling. 

Officer(John Cleese): Don't give me that, sir ... you couldn't smuggle a piece of greaseproof paper let alone a case full of watches. 

Man(Michael Palin): What do you mean! I've smuggled watches before, you know! I've smuggled bombs, cameras, microfilms, aircraft components, you name it - I've smuggled it. 

Officer(John Cleese): Now come along please, you're wasting our time... move along please. 

Man(Michael Palin): Look! 

<Direction: he opens his case to reveal it stuffed full of watches and clocks> 

Man(Michael Palin): Look - look at this. 

Officer(John Cleese): Look, for all I know, sir, you could've bought these in London before you ever went to Switzerland. 

Man(Michael Palin): What? I wouldn't buy two thousand clocks. 

Officer(John Cleese): People do, now close your case move along please come on. Don't waste our time, we're out to catch the real smugglers. Come on.

Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes. Yes it is. Goodnight. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Oh. Oh dear, I don't think I'm doing very well. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Why do you say that? 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Well I don't know. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Do you say it because you didn't know? 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Well. I, I, I, I don't know. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Five, four, three, two, one, zero! Right! 

<Direction: makes face and strange noise> 

Stig(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry, I'm confused. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well why do you think I did that then? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Aren't you curious? 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Well yes. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well, why didn't you ask me? 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Well...I...er...

Stig(Graham Chapman): What's going on? What's going on? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): You've got very good marks. 

<Direction: hysterically> 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Well I don't care, I want to know what's going on! I think you're deliberately trying to humiliate people, and I'm going straight out of here and I'm going to tell the police exactly what you do to people and I'm going to make bloody sure that you never do it again. There, what do you think of that? What do you think of that? 

<Direction: The judges give him very high marks.> 

Interviewer(None): Very 

Interviewer(John Cleese): good marks. 

Stig(Graham Chapman): Oh, oh well, do I get the job? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, well, I'm afraid not. I'm afraid all the vacancies were filled several weeks ago. 

<Direction: They fall about laughing. Cut to man sitting at desk.> 

Man(Michael Palin): Well that was all good fun, and we all had a jolly good laugh, but I would like to assure you that you'd never be treated like that if you had an interview here at the Careers Advisory Board. Perhaps I should introduce myself. I am the Head of the Careers Advisory Board. I wanted to be a doctor, but there we are, I'm Head of the Careers Advisory Board. 

<Direction: emotionally he weeps, then recovers> 

Man(Michael Palin): Never mind, now I wonder if you've ever considered what a very profitable line of work this man is in. 

<Direction: Cut to front door of a flat. Man walks up to the door and rings bell. He is dressed smartly.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Burglar! 

<Direction: longish pause while he waits, he rings again woman appears at other side of door>

Man(Eric Idle): Burglar, madam. 

Woman(John Cleese): What do you want? 

Man(Eric Idle): I want to come in and steal a few things, madam. 

Woman(John Cleese): Are you an encydopaedia salesman? 

Man(Eric Idle): No madam, I'm a burglar, I burgle people. 

Woman(John Cleese): I think you're an encyclopaedia salesman. 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh I'm not, open the door, let me in please. 

Woman(John Cleese): If I let you in you'll sell me encyclopaedias. 

Man(Eric Idle): I won't, madam. I just want to come in and ransack the flat. Honestly. 

Woman(John Cleese): Promise. No encyclopaedias? 

Man(Eric Idle): None at all. 

Woman(John Cleese): All right. 

<Direction: she opens door> 

Woman(John Cleese): You'd better come in then. 

<Direction: Man enters it through door.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Mind you I don't know whether you've really considered the advantages of owning a really fine set of modern encyclopaedias... 

<Direction: he pockets valuable> 

Man(Eric Idle): You know, they can really do you wonders. 

<Direction: Cut back to man at desk.> 

Man(Michael Palin): That man was a successful encyclopaedia salesman. But not all encyclopaedia salesmen are successful. Here is an unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesman. 

<Direction: Cut to very tall building; a body flies out of a high window and plummets. Cut back to man at desk.> 

Man(Michael Palin): Now here are two unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesmen. 

<Direction: Cut to a different tall building; two bodies fly out of a high window. Cut back to man at desk.> 

Man(Michael Palin): I think there's a lesson there for all of us. 

None(None): CAPTION: '"MAN'S CRISIS OF IDENTITY IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY" WAS CONCIEVED, WRITTEN AND PERFORMED BY... (CREDITS)' 

<Direction: In the foreground we see a telephone. In the very distant background we see the 'It's' man. The telephone starts to ring. The 'It's' man runs towards the camera and the telephone (speeded up). He arrives at the telephone, picks up the reciever and is about to speak into the mouthpiece when he remembers the camera. He puts his hand over the mouthpiece and says to the camera:>

Man(Michael Palin): I thought you did that so well Mr Figgis, could I have your autograph? 

Figgis(Graham Chapman): You certainly can 

<Direction: Presenter sign autograph. Part of his signature gets away (animation) and eventually leads us into the title: 'It's the Arts'. Classical music plays.> 

Figgis(Graham Chapman): Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Panties...I'm sorry...Schumann, Schubert, Mendelssohn and Bach. Names that will live for ever. But there is one composer whose name is never included with the greats. Why is it that the world never remembered the name of Johann Gambolputty de von Ausfern- schplenden- schlitter- crasscrenbon- fried- digger- dingle- dangle- dongle- dungle- burstein- von- knacker- thrasher- apple- banger- horowitz- ticolensic- grander- knotty- spelltinkle- grandlich- grumblemeyer- spelterwasser- kurstlich- himbleeisen- bahnwagen- gutenabend- bitte- ein- nÃ¼rnburger- bratwustle- gerspurten- mitz- weimache- luber- hundsfut- gumberaber- shÃ¶nedanker- kalbsfleisch- mittler- aucher von Hautkopft of Ulm? To do justice to this man, thought by many to be the greatest name in German Baroque music, we present a profile of Johann Gambolputty de von Ausfern- schplenden- schlitter- crasscrenbon- fried- digger- dingle- dangle- dongle- dungle- burstein- von- knacker- thrasher- apple- banger- horowitz- ticolensic- grander- knotty- spelltinkle- grandlich- grumblemeyer- spelterwasser- kurstlich- himbleeisen- bahnwagen- gutenabend- bitte- ein- nÃ¼rnburger- bratwustle- gerspurten- mitz- weimache- luber- hundsfut- gumberaber- shÃ¶nedanker- kalbsfleisch- mittler- aucher von Hautkopft of Ulm.

<Direction: as he speaks intercut with shots of Karl nodding and trying to look interested> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes, if I may just cut in on you there, Herr Gambolputty de von Ausfern- schplenden- schlitter- crasscrenbon- fried- digger- dingle- dangle- dongle- dungle- burstein- von- knacker- thrasher- apple- banger- horowitz- ticolensic- grander- knotty- spelltinkle- grandlich- grumblemeyer- spelterwasser- kurstlich- himbleeisen- bahnwagen- gutenabend- bitte- ein- nÃ¼rnburger- bratwustle- gerspurten- mitz- weimache- luber- hundsfut- gumberaber- shÃ¶nedanker- kalbsfleisch- mittler- aucher von Hautkopft of Ulm, and ask you - just quickly - if there's any particular thing that you remember about Johann Gambolputty de von Ausfern- schplenden- schlitter- crasscrenbon- fried- digger- dingle- dangle- dongle- dungle- burstein- von- knacker- thrasher- apple- banger- horowitz- ticolensic- grander- knotty- spelltinkle- grandlich- grumblemeyer- spelterwasser- kurstlich- himbleeisen- bahnwagen- gutenabend- bitte- ein- nÃ¼rnburger- bratwustle- gerspurten- mitz- weimache- luber- hundsfut- gumberaber- shÃ¶nedanker- kalbsfleisch- mittler- aucher von Hautkopft of Ulm? 

<Direction: No response. He shakes the old man, then gets up and listens to his heart. Realizing with exasperation that his interviewee has died, he starts digging a grave. Cut back to presenter.>

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: leading to: A garret room with a bare table. Around it are grouped four desperate-looking robbers. The Boss has a rolled-up map. One of the gang, the fifth, is looking out of the window.> 

Boss(Michael Palin): All clear? 

Fifth(John Cleese): All clear, boss. 

<Direction: unfolding big map across table; talking carefuly> 

Boss(Michael Palin): Right ... this is the plan then. At 10:45 .. you, Reg, collect me and Ken in the van, and take us round to the British Jewellery Centre in the High Street. We will arrive outside the British Jewellery Centre at 10:50 a of m. I shall then get out of the car, you Reg, take it and park it back here in Denver Street, right? At 10:51, I shall enter the British Jewellery Centre, where you, Vic, disguised as a customer, will meet me and hand me Â£5.18.3d. At 10:52, I shall approach the counter and purchase a watch costing Â£5.18.3d. I shall then give the watch to you, Vic. You'll go straight to Norman's Garage in East Street. You lads continue back up here at 10:56 and we rendezvous in the back room at the Cow and Sickle, at 11:15. All right, any questions? 

Larry(Terry Jones): We don't seem to be doing anything illegal. 

Boss(Michael Palin): What do you mean? 

Larry(Terry Jones): Well ... we're paying for the watch. 

<Direction: patiently> 

Boss(Michael Palin): Yes... 

<Direction: hesitating paying> 

Larry(Terry Jones): for the watch? 

<Direction: heavily pay> 

Boss(Michael Palin): for it, would they... eh? 

Larry(Terry Jones): Look! I don't like this outfit. 

Boss(Michael Palin): Why not? 

<Direction: at last feeling free to say what's on his mind> 

Larry(Terry Jones): Well, we never break the bloody law. 

<Direction: General consternation.> 

Boss(Michael Palin): What d'you mean? 

Larry(Terry Jones): Well, look at that bank job last week. 

Boss(Michael Palin): What was wrong with that? 

Larry(Terry Jones): Well having to go in there with a mask on and ask for Â£15 out of my deposit account; that's what was wrong with it. 

Boss(Michael Palin): Listen! What are you trying to say, Larry? 

Larry(Terry Jones): Couldn't we just steal the watch, Boss 

Boss(Michael Palin): Oh, you dumb cluck! We spent weeks organizing this job. Reg rented a room across the road and filmed the people going in and out every day. Vic spent three weeks looking at watch catalogues...until he knew the price of each one backwards, and now I'm not going to risk the whole raid just for the sake of breaking the law. 

Larry(Terry Jones): Urr... couldn't we park on a double yellow line? 

Boss(Michael Palin): No! 

Larry(Terry Jones): Couldn't we get a dog to foul the foot... 

<Direction: suddenly going pale> 

Reg(Eric Idle): 'Ere, Boss! 

Boss(Michael Palin): What's the matter with you? 

Reg(Eric Idle): I just thought... I left the car on a meter... and it's... 

Boss(Michael Palin): Overdue? 

Reg(Eric Idle): Yes, Boss. 

Boss(Michael Palin): How much? 

<Direction: quaking> 

Reg(Eric Idle): I dunno, Boss... maybe two ... maybe five minutes ... 

Boss(Michael Palin): Five minutes overdue. You fool! You fool! All right ... we've no time to lose. Ken - shave all your hair off, get your passport and meet me at this address in Rio de Janeiro Tuesday night. Vic - go to East Africa, have plastic surgery and meet me there. Reg - go to Canada and work your way south to Nicaragua by July. Larry - you stay here as front man. Give us fifteen minutes then blow the building up. All right, make it fast. 

Larry(Terry Jones): I can't blow the building up. 

Larry(Terry Jones): It's illegal. 

Boss(Michael Palin): Oh bloody hell. Well we'd better give ourselves up then. 

Reg(Eric Idle): We can't, Boss. 

Reg(Eric Idle): We haven't done anything illegal. 

<Direction: Cut to film. Exterior of bank. Three bandits rush out with swag etc. One of them stops to talk to camera raising mask off head.> 

Bandit(Michael Palin): No I think being illegal makes it more exciting. 

Second Bandit(Eric Idle): Yes, I agree. I mean, if you're going to go straight you might as well be a vicar or something. 

<Direction: Cut to vicar, wheeling quickly round to reveal he has his hand in the restoration-fund box.> 

Vicar(Terry Jones): What? 

<Direction: Cut to chartered accountant.> 

Chartered Accountant(John Cleese): I agree. If there were fewer robbers there wouldn't be so many of them, numerically speaking. 

<Direction: Cut to pepperpot.> 

Pepperpot(Michael Palin): I think sexual ecstasy is over-rated. 

<Direction: Cut to Scotsman.> 

Scotsman(Michael Palin): Well, how very interesting, because I'm now made entirely of tin. 

<Direction: Cut to Police Inspector Praline.> 

Praline(John Cleese): After a few more of these remarks, I shall be appearing in a sketch, so stay tuned. 

<Direction: Cut to policeman.> 

Policeman(Graham Chapman): It's the uniform that puts them off, that and my bad breath. 

<Direction: Cut to judge in full long wig and robes and a QC also wearing wig and robes. matter of factly> 

Judge(Terry Jones): We like dressing up, yes... 

<Direction: Cut to Inspector Praline.> 

Inspector Praline(John Cleese): Hello again. I am at present still on film, but in a few seconds I shall be appearing in the studio. Thank you. 

<Direction: Cut to studio. A door opens. Inspector Praline looks round door. to camera he walks in followed by Superintendent Parrot and goes to desk> 

Praline(John Cleese): Mr Milton? You are sole proprietor and owner of the Whizzo Chocolate Company? 

Milton(Terry Jones): I am. 

Praline(John Cleese): Superintendent Parrot and I are from the hygiene squad.We want to have a word with you about your box of chocolates entitled the Whizzo Quality Assortment. 

Milton(Terry Jones): Ah, yes. 

<Direction: producing box of chocolate> 

Praline(John Cleese): If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the Cherry Fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that. 

Milton(Terry Jones): Agreed. 

Praline(John Cleese): Next we have number four, 'Crunchy Frog'. 

Milton(Terry Jones): An, yes. 

Praline(John Cleese): Am I right in thinking there's a real frog in here? 

Milton(Terry Jones): Yes. A little one. 

Praline(John Cleese): What sort of frog? 

Milton(Terry Jones): A dead frog. 

Praline(John Cleese): Is it cooked? 

Milton(Terry Jones): No. 

Praline(John Cleese): What, a raw frog? 

<Direction: Superintendent Parrot looks increasingly queasy.> 

Milton(Terry Jones): We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose. 

Praline(John Cleese): That's as may be, but it's still a frog! 

Milton(Terry Jones): What else? 

Praline(John Cleese): Well don't you even take the bones out? 

Milton(Terry Jones): If we took the bones out it wouldn't be crunchy would it? 

Praline(John Cleese): Superintendent Parrot ate one of those. 

Parrot(Graham Chapman): Excuse me a moment. 

<Direction: exits hurriedly> 

Praline(John Cleese): Well, the Superintendent thought it was an almond whirl. People won't expect there to be a frog in there. They're bound to think it's some sort of mock frog. 

<Direction: insulted> 

Milton(Terry Jones): Mock frog? We use no artificial preservatives or additives of any kind! 

Praline(John Cleese): Nevertheless, I must warn you that in future you should delete the words 'crunchy frog', and replace them with the legend, 'crunchy raw unboned real dead frog' if you want to avoid prosecution. 

Milton(Terry Jones): What about our sales? 

Praline(John Cleese): I'm not interested in your sales! I have to protect the general public! Now what about this one. 

<Direction: superintendent enters superintendent nods exit superintendent> 

Praline(John Cleese): What sort of confection is this? 

Milton(Terry Jones): We use choicest juicy chunks of fresh Cornish ram's bladder, emptied, steamed, flavoured with sesame seeds, whipped into a fondue and garnished with lark's vomit. 

Praline(John Cleese): Larks vomit? 

Milton(Terry Jones): Correct. 

Praline(John Cleese): Well it don't say nothing about that here. 

Milton(Terry Jones): Oh yes it does, on the bottom of the box, after monosodium glutamate. 

<Direction: looking> 

Praline(John Cleese): Wel I hardly think this is good enough. I think it's be more appropriate if the box bore a great red label warning lark's vomit. 

Milton(Terry Jones): Our sales would plummet! 

Praline(John Cleese): Well why don't you move into more conventional areas of confectionary, like praline or lime cream; a very popular flavor, I'm lead to understand. 

<Direction: superintendent exits> 

Praline(John Cleese): anthrax ripple! What's this one: 'spring surprise'? 

Milton(Terry Jones): Ah - now, that's our speciality - covered with darkest creamy chocolate. When you pop it into your mouth steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks. 

Praline(John Cleese): Well where's the pleasure in that? If people place a nice chocky in their mouth, they don't want their cheeks pierced. In any case this is an inadequate description of the sweetmeat. I shall have to ask you to accompany me to the station. 

<Direction: getting up from the desk and being led away> 

Milton(Terry Jones): It's a fair cop. 

Praline(John Cleese): Stop talking to the camera. 

Milton(Terry Jones): I'm sorry. 

<Direction: Supeintendent Parrot enters the room as Inspector Praline and Milton leave, and addresses the camera.> 

Parrot(Graham Chapman): If only the general public would take more care when buying its sweeties, it would reduce the number of man-hours lost to the nation and they would spend less time having their stomachs pumped and sitting around in public lavatories. 

Announcer(John Cleese): The BBC would like to apologize for the extremely poor quality of the next announcement, only he's not at all well. 

Parrot(Graham Chapman): We present 'The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker', 

<Direction: Cut to a nice suburban street. Inside the house a stockbroker (Michael) is finishing his breakfast. His attractive wife looks on. He picks up his hat, rises, kisses her goodbye, and leaves. As he does so, she takes off her wrap and two men dressed only in briefs (Graham and Terry J) step out of the kitchen cupboard. In the front garden the stockbroker bids his neighbour (Graham) good morning; as he moves off a large African native throws an assegai, killing the neighbour. The stockbroker, not noticing this, moves on. A high street: he walks into a newsagents. Behind the counter a naked young lady gives him his newspaper. Taking his change without apparently noticing her he leaves. A bus queue: the stockbroker is at the head of it; there are four people behind him. As they wait, the Frankenstein monster comes up behind them and works his way along the queue, killing each member as he goes. He has just reached the stockbroker - who has not seen him - when the bus arrives and the stockbroker gets on. On the bus: all the other passengers are uniformed soldiers. The bus drives along a road past explosions and gunfire. A hand grenade comes through the window and lands on the seat next to the stockbroker. The soldiers leave the bus rapidly; the stockbroker calmly leaves the bus and walks down the street, in which the soldiers are engaged in a pitched battle. The stockbroker hails a taxi; it stops. No driver is visible. The stockbroker gets in and it drives off. In the stockbroker's office: a secretary is dead across her typewriter with a knife in her back; at the back of the office a pair of legs swing gently from the ceiling; a couple are snogging at his desk. Unconcerned, the stockbroker sits down. Furtively he looks round, then takes from the desk drawer a comic-book entitled 'Thrills and Adventure'. We see the frames of the comic strip. A Superman-type character and a girl are shrinking from an explosion. She is saying 'My God, his nose just exploded with enough force to destroy his kleenex'. In the next frame, the Superman character is saying 'If only I had a kleenex to lend him - or even a linen handkerchief - but these trousers...!! No back pocket!' In the frame beneath, he flies from side to side attempting to escape; finally he breaks through, bringing the two frames above down on himself. Cut to a picture of a safety curtain. An animated man come in front of it and says:> 

Man(None): Coming right up - the theatre sketch - so don't move! 

<Direction: The front stalls of a theatre. It is a first night - a lot of people in dinner jackets etc. About three rows back there is a spare seat. A general rustle of programmes, chocolates and theatrical murmurs. Suddenly a Sioux Indian enters, clad only in loin cloth, wearing war paint and with a single strip of hair in the middle of his head and feather. He carries a bow and a quiver of arrows. He settles into the empty seat. The man next to him shifts uneasily and looks straight ahead. The Indian looks his neighbour up and down a couple of times. always speaking with full gestures>

Indian(Eric Idle): When moon high over prairie ... when wolf howl over mountain, when mighty wind roar through Yellow Valley, we go Leatherhead Rep - block booking, upper circle - whole tribe get it on 3/6d each. 

Man(Graham Chapman): That's very good. 

Indian(Eric Idle): Stage Manager, Stan Wilson, heap good friend Redfoot tribe. After show we go pow-wow speakum with director, Sandy Camp, in snug bar of Bell and Compasses. Him mighty fine director. Him heap famous. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Oh - I don't know him myself.

Man(Graham Chapman): Oh that's good... 

Indian(Eric Idle): We do 'Dial M for Murder'. Chief Running Elk - him kill buffalo with bare hands, run thousand paces when the sun is high - him play Chief Inspector Hardy - heap good fine actor. 

Man(Graham Chapman): You do a lot of acting do you? 

Indian(Eric Idle): Yes. Redfoot tribe live by acting and hunting. 

Man(Graham Chapman): You don't fight any more? 

Indian(Eric Idle): Yes! Redfoot make war! When Chief Yellow Snake was leader, and Mighty Eagle was in land of forefather, we fight Pawnee at Oxbow Crossing. When Pawnee steal our rehearsal copies of 'Reluctant Debutante' we kill fifty Pawnee - houses heap full every night. Heap good publicity. 

<Direction: The lights start to dim. Auditorium chatter subsides. visibly relieved>

Mum(Terry Jones): D'you read that, Edgar? 

Dad(Ian Davidson): What's that dear? 

Mum(Terry Jones): There's been another Indian massacre at Dorking Civic Theatre. 

Dad(None): About time too dear... 

Mum(Terry Jones): 'Those who were left alive at the end got their money back'. 

Dad(None): That's what live theatre needs - a few more massacres... 

Mum(Terry Jones): 'The police are anxious to speak to anyone who saw the crime, ladies with large breasts, or just anyone who likes policemen.' 

<Direction: Suddenly a policeman walks in between the couple and the camera. to camera> 

Policeman(John Cleese): Yes! Policemen make wonderful friends. So if you are over six feet tall and would like a friend, a pen friend, in the police force, here is the address to write to: 'Mrs Ena Frog, 8 Masonic Apron Street, Cowdenbeath'. Remember - policemen make wonderful friends. So write today and take advantage of our free officer. Thank you. And now for the next sketch. 

<Direction: The policeman removes his helmet, shakes it, proffers it to mum at the table. She takes out a small folded bit of paper, opens and reads.> 

Mum(Terry Jones): A Scotsman on a horse.

<Direction: A Scotsman (John) rides up to the camera and looks around puzzled. In long-shot we see him riding off. At a wee Scottish kirk another Scotsman (Michael) is waiting at the head of the aisle to be married. Intercut between first Scotsman galloping through the countryside and the wedding procession coming up the aisle. The wedding takes place; just as it finishes the first Scotsman rides up to the kirk and rushes in. The assembled congregation look at him in alarm as he surveys them; then he picks up Michael and carries him off. Cut to film of Women's Institute audience applauding.> 

None(None): ANIMATION, 

<Direction: which leads us to the 'Twentieth Century Vole' trademark. Cut to film producer's office. Six writers sitting round a table with one very impressive chair empty at the head of the table. They wait reverently. Suddenly the door of the room flies open and Larry Saltzberg, the film producer, walks in. The writers leap to their feet.>

Larry(Graham Chapman): Oh sit down! Sit down! Sit down! There'll be plenty of time for that later on. Now boys, here's my idea... 

Third Writer(Eric Idle): It's great!

First Writer(None): promise

Larry(Graham Chapman): Get out! 

Fifth Writer(Terry Gilliam): What? 

Larry(Graham Chapman): If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a yes-man! Get out! 

<Direction: fifth writer leaves very fast, the others go very quiet to sixth writer> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): What do you think? 

Sixth Writer(None): Well... I... 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Just because I have an idea it doesn't mean it's great. It could be lousy. 

Sixth Writer(None): It could? 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Yeah! What d'ya think? 

Sixth Writer(None): It's lousy. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): There you are, you see, he spoke his mind. He said my idea was lousy. It just so happens my idea isn't lousy so get out you goddam pinko subversive, get out! 

<Direction: sixth writer exits looking straight at fourth writer> 

Fourth Writer(John Cleese): Well ... I think it's an excellent idea. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Are you a yes-man? 

Fourth Writer(John Cleese): No, no, no, I mean there may be things against it. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): You think it's lousy, huh? 

Fourth Writer(John Cleese): No, no, I mean it takes time. 

<Direction: really threatening> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Are you being indecisive? 

Fourth Writer(John Cleese): Yo. Nes. Perhaps. 

<Direction: runs out> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): I hope you three gentlemen aren't going to be indecisive! 

<Direction: they try to hide under the table> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): What the hell are you doing under that table? 

First Writer(Michael Palin): We dropped our pencils. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Pencil droppers, eh? 

Writers(None): No, no, no, no, no! 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Right. Now I want your opinion of my idea ... 

<Direction: pointing at first writer> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): You... 

<Direction: quaking> 

First Writer(Michael Palin): Oh... 

<Direction: First writer looks around and then faints.> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Has he had a heart attack? 

Second and Third Writers(None): Er... 

Larry(Graham Chapman): If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who have heart attacks. 

<Direction: recovering immediately> 

First Writer(Michael Palin): I feel fine now. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Well, what do you think? 

Writers(None): Oh! Eh! You didn't ask me you asked him. He didn't ask me, he asked him. No, him. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): I've changed my mind. I'm asking you, the one in the middle. 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): The one in the middle? 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Yes, the one in the middle. 

<Direction: the phone rings all jockey for position desperately trying to put the others in the middle and finish sitting on one chair> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): What the hell are you doing? 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): I'm thinking. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Get back in those seats immediately. 

<Direction: back to phone second writer is grabbed by the others and held in the middle chair; Larry finishes with the phone> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Right you. The one in the middle, what do you think? 

<Direction: panic> 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): Er... er... 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Come on! 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): Splunge. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Did he say splunge? 

First and Third Writers(None): Yes. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): What does splunge mean? 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): It means ... it's a great-idea-but-possibly-not-and-I'm-not-being-indecisive! 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Good. Right . .. 

<Direction: to third writer> 

Third Writer(Eric Idle): Er. Splunge? 

Larry(Graham Chapman): OK... 

First Writer(Michael Palin): Yeah. Splunge for me too. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): So all three of you think splunge, huh? 

Writers(None): Yes! 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Well now we're getting somewhere. No, wait. A new angle! In the snow, instead of the tree, I see Rock Hudson, and instead of the dog I see Doris Day and, gentlemen, Doris Day goes up to Rock Hudson and she kisses him. A love story. Intercourse Italian style. David Hemmings as a hippy Gestapo officer. Frontal nudity. A family picture. A comedy. And then when Doris Day's kissed Rock Hudson she says something funny like... 

<Direction: looks at third writer> 

Third Writer(Eric Idle): Er ... Good evening. 

Larry(Graham Chapman): Doris Day's a comedienne, not a newsreader. Get out! 

<Direction: third writer runs looks at second writer> 

Second Writer(Terry Jones): Splunge? 

Larry(Graham Chapman): That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Get out! 

<Direction: second writer leaves looks at first writer> 

First Writer(Michael Palin): Er... er... er... I can't take it anymore. 

<Direction: runs out> 

Larry(Graham Chapman): I like that! I like that, I can't take it any more, and then Rock Hudson says 'I'm a very rich film producer and I need a lobotomy' and then Doris Dog says 'I think you're very handsome and I'm going to take all my clothes off' and then Doris Dog turns into a yak and goes to the bathroom on David Lemming. No, wait, wait!

The track comes straight down from the horizon to camera in valley. At the top of the hill we hear running and heavy breathing. The 'It's' man appears. He runs down the valley to camera but fails to say his line: prompting It's...no...no...it's...it's...it's... finally> 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

<Direction: By the miracle of money we swing into a fantastically expensive opening animation sequence, produced by one of America's very own drop-outs.> 

None(None): In the country. Interviewer with microphone. Behind him a man sits on a wall, with clip-board, binoculars and spotting gear. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Good evening. Tonight we're going to take a hard tough abrasive look at camel spotting. Hello. 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Hello Peter. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Now tell me, what exactly are you doing? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Er well, I'm camel spotting. I'm spotting to see if there are any camels that I can spot, and put them down in my camel spotting book. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Good. And how many camels have you spotted so far? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Oh, well so far Peter, up to the present moment, I've spotted nearly, ooh, nearly one. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Nearly one? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Er, call it none. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Fine. And er how long have you been here? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Three years. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): So, in, er, three years you've spotted no camels? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Yes in only three years. Er, I tell a lie, four, be fair, five. I've been camel spotting for just the seven years. Before that of course I was a Yeti spotter. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): A Yeti spotter, that must have been extremely interesting. 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Oh, it was extremely interesting, very, very - quite... it was dull; dull, dull, dull, oh God it was dull. Sitting in the Waterloo waiting room. Course once you've seen one Yeti you've seen them all. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): And have you seen them all? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Well I've seen one. Well a little one... a picture of a... I've heard about them. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well, now tell me, what do you do when you spot a camel? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Er, I take its number. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Camels don't have numbers. 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Ah, well you've got to know where to look. Er, they're on the side of the engine above the piston box. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): What? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Ah - of course you've got to make sure it's not a dromedary. 'Cos if it's a dromedary it goes in the dromedary book. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well how do you tell if it's a dromedary? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Ah well, a dromedary has one hump and a camel has a refreshment car, buffet, and ticket collector. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Mr Sopwith, aren't you in fact a train spotter? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): What? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Don't you in fact spot trains? 

Spotter(Eric Idle): Oh, you're no fun anymore.

Accountant(Michael Palin): Lady Chairman, sir, shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars, plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds, this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): A shilling Wilkins? 

Accountant(Michael Palin): Er, roughly, yes sir. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi-million pound corporation and you are a very new chartered Accountant. Isn't it possible there may have been some mistake? 

Accountant(Michael Palin): Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet. 

Board Member(John Cleese): Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net or gross? 

Accountant(Michael Palin): It's British sir. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes, has tax been paid on it? 

Accountant(Michael Palin): Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.

Accountant(Michael Palin): Yes all of it. 

Board Member(John Cleese): You naughty person. 

Accountant(Michael Palin): It's my first. Please be gentle with me. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): I'm afraid it's my unpleasant duty to inform you that you're fired. 

Accountant(Michael Palin): Oh please, please. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): No, out! 

<Direction: crying he leaves> 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes, there's no place for sentiment in big business.

<Direction: Cut to redcoat.> 

Redcoat(Michael Palin): A little joke, a little jest. Nothing to worry about ladies and gentlemen. Now we've got some science fiction for you, some sci-fi, something to send the shivers up your spine, send the creepy crawlies down your lager and limes. All the lads have contributed to it, it's a little number entitled, Science Fiction Sketch... 

<Direction: Zoom through the galaxy to the solar system. very resonant> 

American Voice(John Cleese): The Universe consists of a billion, billion galaxies... 77,000,000,000 miles across, and every galaxy is made up of a billion, zillion stars and around these stars circle a billion planets, and of all of these planets the greenest and the pleasantest is the planet Earth, in the system of Sol, in the Galaxy known as the Milky Way ... And it was to this world that creatures of an alien planet came ... to conquer and destroy the very heart of civilization... 

<Direction: Mix into close-up of railway station sign: 'New Pudsey'. Pull out to mid-shot of a couple walking towards camera. They are middle-aged. He (Graham) wears a cricket blazer and grey flannels and a carrier bag. She (Eric) wears a fussy print dress. gently camera pans off them; they both look disappointed; camera picks up instead a smart little business man, in bowler, briefcase and pinstripes> 

American Voice(John Cleese): ... Harold Potter, gardener, and tax official, first victim of Creatures from another Planet. 

<Direction: Weird electronic music. Sinister atmosphere. Follow him out of station. Cut-away to flying saucer, over day skyline. Back to Potter as he walks up suburban road. Back to flying saucer. It bleeps as if it has seen its prey and changes direction. Cut back to Potter just about to open his front gate. Shot from over the other side of the road. Cut to flying saucer sending down ray. Potter freezes . . . shivers and turns into a Scotsman with kilt, and red beard. His hand jerks out in front of him and he spins round and scuttles up road in fast motion, to the accompaniment of bagpipe music. Cut to close-up of newspaper with banner headline: 'Man turns into a Scotsman'.> 

Newsvendor's Voice(None): Read all abaht it! Read all abaht it! Man turns into Scotsman! 

<Direction: Mix through to Potter's front gate. His wife is being interviewed by obvious plainclothes man.> 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Mrs Potter - you knew Harold Potter quite well I believe? 

Wife(Eric Idle): Oh yes quite well. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Yes. 

Wife(Eric Idle): He was my husband. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination towards being a Scotsman before this happened? 

<Direction: shocked> 

Wife(Eric Idle): No, no, not at all. He was not that sort of person... 

Inspector(Terry Jones): He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes? 

Wife(Eric Idle): No, no. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): He never got drunk at night or bought home black puddings? 

Wife(Eric Idle): No, no. Not at all. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity? 

Wife(Eric Idle): No, no, not at all. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a Scotsman whatsoever? 

Wife(Eric Idle): Absolutely, yes. 

<Direction: suddenly remembering> 

Wife(Eric Idle): Mind you he did always watch Dr Finlay on television. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Ah-hah! ... Well that's it, you see. That's how it starts. 

Wife(Eric Idle): I beg your pardon? 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Well you see Scottishness starts with little things like that, and works up. You see, people don't just turn into a Scotsman for no reason at all... 

<Direction: goes rigid: with Scots accent:> 

Inspector(Terry Jones): No further questions! 

<Direction: The words are hardly out of his mouth when he turns into a Scotsman and spins round and disappears up road in fast motion. Pan with him. Cut to bus queue: man in a city suit and bowler hat suddenly changes into a Scotsman with beard, twizzles round and speeds out of shot. Cut to street policeman pointing way for woman with a pram. Suddenly he changes into a Scotsman and scuffles out of shot. She looks aghast for a moment and then she too changes into a Scotsman and hurtles off after him. The baby suddenly develops a beard and the pram follows her. Single shot of black jazz musician in cellar blowing a blues sax solo. He changes and whizzes off. Squad of soldiers being drilled. Suddenly they all change into bearded Scotsmen and race off in unison. Pan with them past sign: 'Welsh Guard'. Quick animated shot of flying saucer disappearing over city skyline. Cut to big close-up of passionate kiss. It goes on for some moments. Foggy lens... romantic music. Keep on big close-up as they talk. She is none too intelligent.> 

She(Donna Reading): Charles... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Darling... 

She(None): Charles... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Darling, darling... 

She(None): Charles... there's something I've got to tell you... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): What is it darling? 

She(None): It's daddy ... he's turned into a Scotsman... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): What! Mr Llewellyn? 

She(None): Yes, Charles. Help me, please help me. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): But what can I do? 

She(None): Surely, Charles, you're the Chief Scientist at the Anthropological Research Institute, at Butley Down - an expert in what makes people change from one nationality to another. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): So I am! 

<Direction: pull out to reveal they are in a laboratory; he is in a white coat, she is in something absurdly sexy> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): This is right up my street! 

She(None): Oh good. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a Scotsman? 

<Direction: tentatively Em, for business reasons?> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No, no! Only because he has no control over his own destiny! Look I'll show you... 

<Direction: He presses a button on a control board and a laboratory TV screen lights op with the words 'only because they have no control over their own destinies'. I see.> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Yes! So this means that some person or persons unknown is turning all these people into Scotsmen... 

She(None): Oh, what kind of heartless fiend could 

She(None): do 

She(None): that to a man? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): I don't know ... I don't know ... all I know is that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked with Scotsmen... 

She(None): Ooh!... 

<Direction: Zoom in on her face. Cut to as many bearded Scotsmen as possible, hurtling through wood in fast motion. Follow them, ending up with skyline shot as per 'Seventh Seal'. They all still have the arm outstretched in front of them and as always they are accompanied by bagpipe music. Shot of border with large notice: 'Scotland Welcomes You'.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The over-crowding was pitiful. 

<Direction: They all dash across harder and then stop abruptly once they're over. They stand around looking lost.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): Three men to a caber. 

<Direction: Cut to three Scotsmen tossing one caber. Cut to Scots wife in bed with bearded husband. Pull back to reveal five other Scotsmen in the bed. Short but brilliant piece of animation from T. Gilliam to show England emptying of people and Scotland filling up, ending with a till sound and a till sign coming up out of England reading: 'Empty'. Track into England. Film of a deserted street. Wind, a dog sniffing, newspaper blowing along street. Close-up sign on shop door 'Gone to lunch Scotland'. Close-up another sign on a shop door.' 'McClosed'. Shop sign: McWoolworths & Co'.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): For the few who remained, life was increasingly difficult. 

<Direction: Man suddenly folds up newspaper and runs round corner. Re-emerges driving bus. Drives it halfway to stop and then leaps out with bus still moving. Runs to stop, and puts out hand. Bus stops. He leaps on, rings bell, runs round to front and drives the bus off again. As bus drives out of frame we just see a couple of Scotsmen flashing past camera with arms outstretched. Pan slowly round empty football stadium. Eventually we pick up a solitary spectator, halfway up and halfway along in stand opposite where the players come out. He suddenly leaps to his feet cheering. Cut to players tunnel and one player emerging and a referee with ball. They kick off. Player goes straight down field and scores. Spectator disapppointed. A quick shot of flying saucer again. Studio: the laboratory again. Charles is looking through microscope, when the door flies open and she bursts in. Charles! Thank goodness I've found you! It's mummy!> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Hello mummy. 

She(None): No, no, mummy's turned into a Scotsman... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Oh how horrible... Will they stop at nothing? 

She(None): I don't know - do you think they will? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): I meant that rhetorically. 

She(None): What does rhetorically mean? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): It means, I didn't expect an answer. 

She(None): Oh I see. Oh, you're so clever, Charles. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Did mummy say anything as she changed? 

<Direction: with an air of tremendous revelation Yes! she did, now you come to mention it A long pause as he waits expectantly.> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Well, what was it? 

She(None): Oh, she said ... 'Them!' 

<Direction: thrilling chord of jangling music and quick zoom into her face Is there someone at the door?> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No ... It's just the incidental music for this scene. 

She(None): Oh I see... 

Charles(Graham Chapman): 'Them' ... Wait a minute! 

She(None): A 

She(None): whole 

She(None): minute? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No, I meant that metaphorically ... 'Them' ... 'Them' ... She was obviously referring to the people who turned her into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were ... And why 'They' were doing it... Who are 'Them'? 

<Direction: Crashing chord... cut to a small still of a Scottish crofier's cottage on a lonely moor. Slow zoom in on the cottage.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): Then suddenly a clue turned up in Scotland. Mr Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop, received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda. 

<Direction: Mix to interior of highland menswear shop. An elderly Scottish couple are poring over a letter which they have on the counter. Oil lamps etc.> 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000 kilts into the van? 

Angus(Michael Palin): I'll have t'do it in two goes. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda is two million, two hundred thousand light years away? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Is that so? 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Aye ... and you've never been further than Berwick-on-Tweed... 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... Â£18.10.0d a kilt ...that's ... 

<Direction: calculates with abacus> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Â£900,000,000 - and that's without sporrans! 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Aye ... I think you ought not to go, Angus. 

<Direction: with visionary look in his eyes> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye ... we'd be able to afford writing paper with our names on it... We'd be able to buy that extension to the toilet... 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Aye ... but he hasn't signed the order yet, has he? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Who? 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Ach ... the man from Andromeda. 

Angus(Michael Palin): Och ... well ... he wasna really a man, d'you ken ... 

<Direction: Creepy music starts to edge in. narrowing eyes> 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Not really a man? 

<Direction: sweating as the music rises> 

Angus(Michael Palin): He was as strange a thing as ever I saw, or ever I hope to see, God willing. He was a strange unearthly creature - a quivering, glistening mass... 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Angus Podgorny, what 

Mrs Podgorny(None): do 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): y'mean? 

Angus(Michael Palin): He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange! 

<Direction: Jarring chord. Police station: a police sergeant is talking over the counter to a girl dressed in a short frilly tennis dress. She holds a racquet and tennis balls.> 

Sergeant(John Cleese): A blancmange, eh? 

Girl(Eric Idle): Yes, that's right. I was just having a game of doubles with Sandra and Jocasta, Alec and David... 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Hang on! 

Girl(Eric Idle): What? 

Sergeant(John Cleese): There's five. 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Five people . . . how do you play doubles with five people? 

Girl(Eric Idle): Ah, well ... we were... 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Sounds a bit funny if you ask me ... playing doubles with five people... 

Girl(Eric Idle): Well we often play like that... Jocasta plays on the side receiving service... 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Oh yes? 

Girl(Eric Idle): Yes. It helps to speed the game up and make it a lot faster, and it means Jocasta isn't left out. 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Look, are you asking me to believe that the five of you was playing doubles, when on the very next court there was a blancmange playing by itself?. 

Girl(Eric Idle): That's right, yes. 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Well answer me this then - why didn't Jocasta play the blancmange at singles, while you and Sandra and Alec and David had a proper game of doubles with four people? 

Girl(Eric Idle): Because Jocasta always plays with us. She's a friend of ours. 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly good game of doubles? 

Girl(Eric Idle): It's not messing it up, officer, we like to play with five. 

Sergeant(John Cleese): Look it's 

Sergeant(None): your 

Sergeant(John Cleese): affair if you want to play with five people ... but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon, right? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz... they wouldn't go calling it doubles. 

Girl(Eric Idle): But what about the blancmange? 

Sergeant(John Cleese): That could play Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. 

<Direction: Cut back to Podgorny's shop. He and his wife are frozen in the positions in which we left them. They pick up the conversation as if nothing had happened.> 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Oh, a blancmange gave you an order for 48,000,000 kilts? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye! 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): And you 

Mrs Podgorny(None): believed 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): it? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye, I did. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Och, you're a stupid man, Angus Podgorny. 

<Direction: getting a little angry bet> 

Angus(Michael Palin): I believe it. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Even if it's from a blancmange? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Och, woman, if a blancmange is prepared to come 2,200,000 light years to purchase a kilt, they must be fairly keen on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat on a spike. Mary, we'll be rich! We'll be rich! 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Oh, but Angus... he hasna given you an earnest of his good faith! 

Angus(Michael Palin): Ah mebbe not but he has gi' me this... 

<Direction: brings out piece of folded paper from sporran> 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): What is it now? 

Angus(Michael Palin): An entry form for the British Open Tennis Championships at Wimbledon Toon ... signed and seconded. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Och, but Angus, ye ken full well that Scots folk dinna know how to play the tennis to save their lives. 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye, but I must go though dear, I dinna want to seem ungrateful. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Ach! Angus, I wilna let you make a fool o'yourself. 

Angus(Michael Palin): But I must. 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Och, no you'll not ... 

<Direction: Close-up on Angus.> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Oh, Mary... 

<Direction: suddenly we hear a strange creaking and a slurping noise; a look of horror comes into his eyes> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Oh, oh, Mary! Look out! Look out! 

<Direction: Big close-up of Mrs Podgorny's eyes starting out from head.> 

Mrs Podgorny(Terry Jones): Urrgh. It's the blancmange. 

<Direction: Blur focus. Cut to a desk for police spokesman. A peaked-capped policeman sits there, reading 'The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire' by Googie Withers. He lowers book and talks chattily to camera.> 

Policeman(Graham Chapman): Oh, now this is where Mr Podgorny could have saved his wife's life. If he'd gone to the police and told them that he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the Galaxy of Andromeda, we'd have sent a man round to investigate. As it was he did a deal with a blancmange, and the blancmange ate his wife. So if you're going out, or going on holiday, or anything strange happens involving other galaxies, just nip round to your local police station, and tell the sergeant on duty - or his wife - of your suspicions. And the same goes for dogs. So I'm sorry to have interrupted your exciting science fiction story ... but, then, crime's our business you know. So carry on viewing, and my thanks to the BBC for allowing me to have this little chat with you. Goodnight. God bless, look after yourselves. 

<Direction: He is hit on the head by knight in suit of armour with raw chicken. Cut to CID office: a plainclothes detective is sitting in his office. Podgorny is sobbing. softly and understandingly> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Do sit down, Mr Podgorny... I... I ... think what's happened is ... terribly ... terribly... funny .... tragic. But you must understand that we have to catch the creature that ate your wife, and if you could help us answer a few questions, we may be able to help save a few lives. I know this is the way your wife would have wanted it. 

<Direction: He is sitting on the desk next to Podgorny. Podgorny with superhuman control makes a great effort to stop sobbing.> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Aye ... I'll ... do ... my best, sergeant. 

<Direction: slapping Podgorny> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Detective Inspector! 

Angus(Michael Palin): Er, detective inspector. 

<Direction: getting up and talking sharply and fast> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Now then. The facts are these. You received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from a blancmange from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda ... you'd just shown your wife an entry form for Wimbledon, which you'd filled in... when you turned round and saw her legs disappearing into a blancmange. Is that correct? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Yes, sir. 

Detective(Eric Idle): Are you mad? 

Angus(Michael Palin): No, sir. 

Detective(Eric Idle): Well that's a relief. 'Cos if you were, your story would be less plausible. 

<Direction: detective brings out photograph of blancmange> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Now then, do you recognize this? 

<Direction: with a squeak of fear> 

Angus(Michael Palin): Oh yes. That's the one that ate my Mary! 

Detective(Eric Idle): Good. His name's Riley... Jack Riley... He's that most rare of criminals ... a blancmange impersonator and cannibal. 

Angus(Michael Palin): But what about the 48,000,000 kilts and the Galaxy of Andromeda? 

Detective(Eric Idle): I'm afraid that's just one of his stories. You must understand that a blancmange impersonator and cannibal has to use some pretty clever stories to allay suspicion. 

Angus(Michael Palin): Then you mean... 

Detective(Eric Idle): Yes. 

Angus(Michael Palin): But... 

Detective(Eric Idle): How? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Detective(Eric Idle): Well... 

Angus(Michael Palin): Not? 

Detective(Eric Idle): I'm afraid so. 

Angus(Michael Palin): Why? 

Detective(Eric Idle): Who knows? 

Angus(Michael Palin): Do you think? 

Detective(Eric Idle): Could be. 

Detective(Eric Idle): I know. 

Angus(Michael Palin): She was... 

<Direction: Suddenly, we hear a strange noise. Angus looks frightened. Detective narrows his eyes and walks over to the door.> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Good lord what's that? 

<Direction: he opens the door and we get a close-up of his staring eyes with sudden fear> 

Detective(Eric Idle): Eh Riley? Riley! Riley! It's not Riley! 

<Direction: Eating noises. He is dragged out of camera shot. Refocus on Angus ... he averts his eyes as we hear the detective inspector off-screen. off-screen> 

Detective(Eric Idle): It's an extra-terrestial being! Agggh! 

<Direction: Jarring chord: Angus shuts his eyes. Cut back to laboratory: she is sitting suggestively on a stool. He is pacing up and down looking intense.> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): So, everyone in England is being turned into Scotsmen, right? 

She(None): Yes. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Now, which is the worst tennis-playing nation in the world? 

She(None): Er ... Australia. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No. Try again. 

She(None): Australia? 

<Direction: testily> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No... try again but say a different place. 

She(None): Oh, I thought you meant I'd said it badly. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No, course you didn't say it badly. Now hurry. 

She(None): Er, Czechoslovakia. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No! Scotland! 

She(None): Of course. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Now ... now these blancmanges, apart from the one that killed Mrs Podgorny have all appeared in which London suburb? 

She(None): Finchley? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No. Wimbledon ... Now do you begin to see the pattern? With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated? 

<Direction: She is thinking really hard. off-screen> 

Norman Hackforth(Terry Jones): For viewers at home, the answer is coming up on your screens. Those of you who wish to play it the hard way, stand upside down with your head in a bucket of piranha fish. Here is the question once again. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated? 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'TENNIS' 

She(None): Cricket. 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No. 

She(None): Pelote? 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No. Wimbledon is most commonly associated with tennis. 

She(None): Of course! Now I see! 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Yes, it all falls into place! 

She(None): The blancmangcs are really Australians trying to get the rights of the pelota rules from the Czech publishers! 

<Direction: heavily> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): No ... not quite ... but, er, just look in here. 

<Direction: He indicates microscope. As she eagerly bends to look into it he picks up a sock filled with sand and without looking strikes her casually over the head with it. She collapses out of sight under desk. He continues to think out loud.> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): Yes. So these blancmanges, blancmange-shaped creatures come from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda. They order 48,000,000 kilts from a Scottish menswear shop ... turn the population of England into Scotsmen (well known as the worst tennis-playing nation on Earth) thus leaving England empty 

Charles(None): during Wimbledon fortnight 

Charles(None): practising 

Charles(Graham Chapman): . This can only mean one thing! 

<Direction: Flash up caption quickly: and CAPTION> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): 'THEY MEAN TO WIN WIMBLEDON' 

Charles(Graham Chapman): They mean to 

Charles(None): win Wimbledon 

Charles(Graham Chapman): ! 

<Direction: Cut to commentator in his box.> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): Well, here at Wimbledon, it's been a most extraordinary week's tennis. The blancmanges have swept the board, winning match after match. Here are just a few of the results: Billie-Jean King eaten in straight sets, Laver smothered whole after winning the first set, and Poncho Gonzales, serving as well as I've never seen him, with some superb volleys and decisive return volleys off the back hand, was sucked through the net at match point and swallowed whole in just under two minutes. And so, here on the final day, there seems to be no players left to challenge the blancmanges. And this could be their undoing, Dan: as the rules of Wimbledon state quite clearly that there must be at least one human being concerned in the final. 

<Direction: we see a three-foot-high blancmange being shepherded onto a tennis court by a Scotsman suddenly exalted> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): there is a human with it. It's Angus Podgorny! The plucky little Scottish tailor ... upon whom everything depends. And so it's Podgorny versus blancmange in this first ever Intergalactic Wimbledon! 

<Direction: Cut to the centre court at Wimbledon or if we can't get it, number one will do. Blancmange and Podgorny on opposite sides net. Another blancmange sitting in umpire's chair. Blancmange serves... a real sizzling ace. Podgorny, who in any case is quivering with fear, doesn't see it.> 

Commentator's Voice(Eric Idle): And it's blancmange to serve and it's a good one. 

Blancmange Umpire(None): Blurb blurble blurb. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Fifteen love. 

<Direction: Blancmange serves again, and again Podgorny misses hopelessly and pathetically. Collage of speeded-up versions of blancmange sewing and Podgorny missing. Cut to scoreboard: BLANCMANGE:> 

Commentator's Voice(Eric Idle): And Podgorny fails to even hit the ball ... but this is no surprise as he hasn't hit the ball once throughout this match. So it's 72 match points to the blancmange now... Podgorny prepares to serve again. 

<Direction: Podgorny fails to serve and we see the scoreboard:> 

Commentator's Voice(Eric Idle): This is indeed a grim day for the human race, Dan. 

<Direction: Just as Podgorny is about to serve we see Mr and Mrs Brainsample jump onto the court brandishing forks and spoons and with napkins tucked into their necks.> 

Commentator's Voice(Eric Idle): But what's this? Two spectators have rushed onto the pitch with spoons and forks... what are they going to do? 

<Direction: Cut to laboratory.> 

Charles(Graham Chapman): They mean to eat the blancmange. 

<Direction: The girl pulls herself up from where she was slumped by microscope. He knocks her out again with a sand-filled sock. Cut back to Wimbledon. Mr and Mrs Brainsample chasing blancmange and eating it.> 

Commentator's Voice(Eric Idle): And they're eating the blancmange ... Yes! The blancmange is leaving the court... it's abandoning the game! This is fantastic! 

<Direction: Cut to Mr and Mrs Brainsample covered in bits of blancmange and licking their fingers.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): Yes it was Mr and Mrs Samuel Brainsample, who, after only a brief and misleadling appearance in the early part of the film, returned to save the Earth ... but why? 

Mr Brainsample(Graham Chapman): Oh, well you see we love blancmanges. My wife makes them. 

American Voice(John Cleese): She makes blancmanages 

American Voice(None): that 

American Voice(John Cleese): size? 

Mr Brainsample(Graham Chapman): Oh, yes. You see we're from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda, and they're all that size there. We tried to tell you at the beginning of the film but you just panned off us. 

<Direction: Cut back to Podgorny on court still trying to serve; at last he makes contact and runs backward and forward to receive his own services.> 

American Voice(John Cleese): So the world was saved! And Angus Podgorny became the first Scotsman to win Wimbledon... fifteen years later.

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Watkins, you've only been in the army a day. 

Watkins(Eric Idle): I know sir but people get killed, properly dead, sir, no barley cross fingers, sir. A bloke was telling me, if you're in the army and there's a war you have to go and fight. 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): That's true. 

Watkins(Eric Idle): Well I mean, blimey, I mean if it was a big war somebody could be hurt.

Colonel(None): join 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): the army? 

Watkins(Eric Idle): For the water-skiing and for the travel, sir. And

Luigi(Michael Palin): Well suppose some of your tanks was to get broken and troops started getting lost, er, fights started breaking out during general inspection, like. 

Dino(Terry Jones): It wouldn't be good for business would it, colonel? 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Are you threatening me?

Mr Verity(Eric Idle): Can I help you, sir? 

Groom(Terry Jones): Er yes. We'd like to buy a bed...a double bed...about fifty pounds? 

Verity(Eric Idle): Oh no, I'm afraid not, sir. Our cheapest bed is eight hundred pounds, sir. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Eight hundred pounds! 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Or, er, perhaps I should have explained. Mr Verity does tend to exaggerate, so every figure he gives you will be ten times too high. Otherwise he's perfectly all right, perfectly ha, ha, ha. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Oh I see. I see.

Groom(Terry Jones): So your cheapest bed then is eighty pounds?

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Er, two foot long. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Two foot long? 

Verity(Eric Idle): Ah yes, you have to remember of course, to multiply everything Mr Lambert says by three. Er, it's nothing he can help, you understand. Apart from that he's perfectly all right. 

Groom(Terry Jones): I see, I'm sorry. 

Verity(Eric Idle): But it does mean that when he says a bed is two foot wide, it is in fact sixty foot wide. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Oh, yes I see... 

Verity(Eric Idle): And that's not counting the mattress. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Oh, how much is that? 

Verity(Eric Idle): Er, Mr Lambert will be able to help you there.

Verity(Eric Idle): Lambert! Will you show these twenty good people the, er, dog kennels, please? 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Mm? Certainly. 

Groom(Terry Jones): Dog kennel? No, no, no, mattresses, mattresses! 

Verity(Eric Idle): Oh no, no you have to say dog kennel to Mr Lambert because if you say mattress he puts a bag over his head. I should have explained. Apart from that he's really all right. 

<Direction: They go to Lambert.> 

Groom(Terry Jones): Ah, hum, er we'd like to see the dog kennels please.

<Direction: he gets in the chest and sings> 

Verity(Eric Idle): 'And did those feet in ancient times, walk upon England's mountains green...' 

<Direction: The manager enters.> 

Manager(John Cleese): Oh dear, did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert? 

<Direction: Manager and Verity continue to sing. Lambert takes bag off head, manager exits after pointing a warning finger at bride and groom. Getting out of chest don't> 

Verity(Eric Idle): ! (exits) 

Groom(Terry Jones): Oh, no, no, no. er,, we'd like to see, see the dog kennels please? 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Yes, second floor. 

Groom(Terry Jones): No, no, look these 

<Direction: pointing> 

Groom(Terry Jones): dog kennels here, see? 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Mattresses? 

Groom(Terry Jones): Oh 

<Direction: jumps> 

Groom(Terry Jones): ...yes. 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Well, if you meant mattress, why dodn't you 

Lambert(None): say 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): a mattress? I mean, it's very confusing for me if you go and say dog kennels when you mean mattress. Why not just say mattress? 

Groom(Terry Jones): Well, I mean you put a bag over your head last time I said mattress. 

<Direction: Bag goes on. Groom looks around guiltily. Verity walks in. Verity heaves a sigh, jumps in box. Manager comes in and joins him, they sing 'And did those feet...'. Another assistant comes in.> 

Assistant(Michael Palin): Did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert? 

Verity(Eric Idle): Twice. 

Assistant(Michael Palin): Hey, everybody, somebody said mattress to Mr Lambert, twice. 

<Direction: Assistant, groom and bride join in the therapy.> 

Verity(Eric Idle): It's not working. We need more! 

<Direction: Cut to crowd in St. Peter's Square singing 'Jerusalem'. Cut to department store. Lambert takes the bag off his head and looks at groom and bride.> 

Lambert(Graham Chapman): Now, er, can I help you? 

Bride(Carol Cleveland): We want a mattress. 

<Direction: Lambert immediately puts bag back on head. Oh. What did you say that for? What did you say that for? weeping> 

Bride(Carol Cleveland): But it's my only line! 

All(None): Well, you didn't have to say it. 

<Direction: They all hop off. She howls. Cut to vox pops.> 

African Native(Terry Jones): Full frontal nudity - not in this part of Esher. 

Chartered Accountant(John Cleese): I would only perform in a scene in which there was full frontal nudity. 

<Direction: Cut to colonel.> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Now, I've noticed a tendency for this programme to get rather silly. Now I do my best to keep things moving along, but I'm not having things getting silly. Those two last sketches I did got very silly indeed, and that last one about the bed was even sillier. Now, nobody likes a good laugh more than I do...except perhaps my wife and some of her friends...oh yes and Captain Johnston. Come to think of it most people likes a good laugh more than I do. But that's beside the point. Now, let's have a good clean healthy outdoor sketch. Get some air into your lungs. Ten, nine, eight and all that. 

<Direction: Cut to two hermits on a hillside.> 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Hello, are you a hermit by any chance? 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes that's right. Are you a hermit? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Yes, I certainly am. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Well I never. What are you getting away from? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh you know, the usual - people, chat, gossip, you know. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Oh I certainly do - it was the same with me. I mean there comes a time when you realize there's no good frittering your life away in idleness and trivial chit-chat. Where's your cave? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh, up the goat track, first on the left. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Oh they're very nice up there, aren't they? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Yes they are, I've got a beauty. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): A bit drafty though, aren't they? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): No, we've had ours insulated. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Oh yes. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Yes, I used birds' nests, moss and oak leaves round the outside. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Oh, sounds marvellous. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh it's a treat, it really is, 'cos otherwise those stone caves can be so grim. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes they really can be, can't they? They really can. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh yes. 

<Direction: Third hermit passes by.> 

Third Hermit(Graham Chapman): Morning Frank. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Morning Norman. Talking of moss, er you know Mr Robinson? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): With the, er, green loin cloth? 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Er no, that's Mr Seagrave. Mr Robinson's the hermit who lodges with Mr Seagrave. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh I see, yes. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes well he's put me onto wattles. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Really? 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes. Swears by them. Yes. 

<Direction: Fourth hermit passes by.> 

Fourth Hermit(John Cleese): Morning Frank. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Morning Lionel. Well he says that moss tends to fall off the cave walls during cold weather. You know you might get a really bad spell and half the moss drops off the cave wall, leaving you cold. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh well, Mr Robinson's cave's never been exactly nirvana has it? 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Well, quite, that's what I mean. Anyway, Mr Rogers, he's the, er, hermit... 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): ... on the end. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): . .. up at the top, yes. Well he tried wattles and he came out in a rash. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes, and there's me with half a wall wattled, I mean what'll I do? 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Well why don't you try birds nests like I've done? Or else, dead bracken. 

<Direction: calling from a distance> 

Fifth Hermit(Terry Jones): Frank! 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Yes Han. 

Fifth Hermit(Terry Jones): Can I borrow your goat? 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Er, yes that'll be all right. Oh leave me a pint for breakfast will you? ... 

<Direction: to first hermit> 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): You see, you know that is the trouble with living half way up a cliff - you feel so cut off. You know it takes me two hours every morning to get out onto the moors, collect my berries, chastise myself, and two hours back in the evening. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Still there's one thing about being a hermit, at least you meet people. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): Oh yes, I wouldn't go back to public relations. 

First Hermit(Michael Palin): Oh well, bye for now Frank, must toddle. 

<Direction: coming on> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Right, you two hermits, stop that sketch. I think it's silly. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): What? 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): It's silly. 

Second Hermit(Eric Idle): What do you mean, you can't stop it - it's on film. 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): That doesn't make any difference to the viewer at home, does it? Come on, get out. Out. Come on out, all of you. Get off, go on, all of you. Go on, move, move. Go on, get out. Come on, get out, move, move. 

<Direction: He shoos them and the film crew off the hillside.> 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: including dancing Botticelli Venus, which links to pet shop: Mr. Praline walks into the shop carrying a dead parrot in a cage. He walks to counter where shopkeeper tries to hide below cash register.> 

Praline(John Cleese): Hello, I wish to register a complaint...Hello? Miss? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): What do you mean, miss? 

Praline(John Cleese): Oh I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint! 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Sorry, we're closing for lunch. 

Praline(John Cleese): Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Oh yes, the, the Norwegian Blue. What's wrong with it? 

Praline(John Cleese): I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. It's dead, that's what's wrong with it! 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, no, it's resting, look! 

Praline(John Cleese): Look my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No no sir. it's not dead. It's resting! 

Praline(John Cleese): Resting? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Yeah, remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, beautiful plumage, innit? 

Praline(John Cleese): The plumage don't enter into it - it's stone dead. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, no - it's just resting! 

Praline(John Cleese): All right then, if it's restin', I'll wake him up! 

<Direction: shouts into cage> 

Praline(John Cleese): Hello Polly! I've got a nice cuttlefish for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot! 

<Direction: jogging the cage> 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): There, it moved! 

Praline(John Cleese): No, he didn't. That was you pushing the cage! 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): I did not. 

Praline(John Cleese): Yes, you did! 

<Direction: takes parrot out of cage, shouts bangs it against the counter throws it in the air and lets it fall to the floor> 

Praline(John Cleese): Now that's what I call a dead parrot. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, no. It's stunned. 

Praline(John Cleese): Look my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago, you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): It's probably pining for the fjords. 

Praline(John Cleese): Pining for the fjords, what kind of talk is that? Look, why did it fall flat on its back the moment I got it home? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on it's back! Beautiful bird, lovely plumage! 

Praline(John Cleese): Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Well of course it was nailed there. Otherwise it would muscle up to those bars and voom. 

Praline(John Cleese): Look matey 

<Direction: picks up the parrot> 

Praline(John Cleese): this parrot wouldn't voom if you put four thousand volts through it! It's bleedin' demised! 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): It's not, it's pining! 

Praline(John Cleese): It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker.This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Well, I'd better replace it, then. 

<Direction: to camera> 

Praline(John Cleese): If you want to get anything done in this country you've got to complain till you're blue in the mouth. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Sorry guv, we're right out of parrots. 

Praline(John Cleese): I see. I see. I get the picture. 

<Direction: pause> 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): I got a slug. 

Praline(John Cleese): Does it talk? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Not really, no. 

Praline(John Cleese): Well, it's scarcely a replacement, then is it? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Listen, I'll tell you what, 

<Direction: handing over a card> 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): tell you what, if you go to my brother's pet shop in Bolton he'll replace your parrot for you. 

Praline(John Cleese): Bolton eh? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Yeah. 

Praline(John Cleese): All right. 

<Direction: He leaves, holding the parrot. CAPTION: 'A SIMILAR PET SHOP IN BOLTON; LANCS' Close-up of sign on door reading: 'Similar Pet Shops, Ltd.' Pull back from sign to see same pet shop. Shopkeeper now has moustache. Praline walks into shop. He looks around with interest, noticing the empty parrot cage still on the floor.> 

Praline(John Cleese): Er, excuse me. This is Bolton, is it? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, no it's, er, Ipswich. 

<Direction: leaves Man in porter's outfit standing at complaints desk for railways. Praline approaches.> 

Praline(John Cleese): I wish to make a complaint. 

Porter(Terry Jones): I don't have to do this, you know. 

Praline(John Cleese): I beg your pardon. 

Porter(Terry Jones): I'm a qualified brain surgeon. I only do this because I like being my own boss. 

Praline(John Cleese): Er, excuse me, this is irrelevant, isn't it. 

Porter(Terry Jones): Oh yeah, it's not easy to pad these out to thirty minutes. 

Praline(John Cleese): Well I wish to make a complaint. I got on the Bolton train and found myself deposited here in Ipswich. 

Porter(Terry Jones): No, this is Bolton. 

Praline(John Cleese): The pet shop owner's brother was lying. 

Porter(Terry Jones): Well you can't blame British Rail for that. 

Praline(John Cleese): If this is Bolton, I shall return to the pet shop. 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'A LITTLE LATER LTD' Praline walks into the shop again.> 

Praline(John Cleese): I understand that this 

Praline(None): is 

Praline(John Cleese): Bolton. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Praline(John Cleese): Well, you told me it was Ipswich. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): It was a pun. 

Praline(John Cleese): A pun? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, no, not a pun, no. What's the other thing which reads the same backwards as forwards? 

Praline(John Cleese): A palindrome? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Yes, yes. 

Praline(John Cleese): It's not a palindrome. The palindrome of Bolton would be Notlob. It don't work. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Look, what do you want. 

Praline(John Cleese): No I'm sorry, I'm not prepared to pursue my line of enquiry any further as I think this is getting too silly. 

<Direction: coming in> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Quite agree. Quite agree. Silly. Silly...silly. Right get on with it. Get on with it. 

<Direction: Cut to announcer eating a yoghurt. seeing camera shuffles paper> 

Announcer(Eric Idle): I'm sorry...and now frontal nudity. 

<Direction: Cut to tracking or hand-held shot down street, keeping up with extremely shabby man in long overcoat. His back is to the camera. He passes two pepperpots and a girl. As he passes each one he opens his coat wide. They react with shocked horror. He does this three times, after the third time he turns to camera and opens his coat wide. He has a big sign hanging round his neck, covering his chest. It says 'boo'. Cut back to announcer eating yoghurt. The colonel comes in and nudges him.> 

Announcer(Eric Idle): Oh, oh I'm sorry. I thought the film was longer. 

<Direction: shuffling papers> 

Announcer(Eric Idle): Ah. Now Notlob, er, Bolton. 

<Direction: Cut to grannies film, which opens with a pan across Bolton. Voice of reporter.>

<Direction: Film of old ladies beating up two young men; then several grannies walking aggressively along street, pushing passers-by aside.> 

First Young Man(Michael Palin): Well they come up to you, like, and push you - shove you off the pavement, like. There's usually four or five of them. 

Second Young Man(Terry Jones): Yeah, this used to be a nice neighbourhood before the old ladies started moving in. Nowadays some of us daren't even go down to the shops. 

Third Young Man(John Cleese): Well Mr Johnson's son Kevin, he don't go out any more. He comes back from wrestling and locks himself in his room. 

<Direction: Film of grannies harrassing an attractive girl.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): What are they in it for, these old hoodlums, these layabouts in lace? 

<Direction: voice over Well it's something to do isn't it? voice over It's good fun. voice over It's like you know, well, innit, eh?> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Favourite targets for the old ladies are telephone kiosks. 

<Direction: Film of grannies carrying off a telephone kiosk; then painting slogans on a wall. coming up to them they clear off, he turns to camera> 

Policeman(Graham Chapman): We have a lot of trouble with these oldies. Pension day's the worst - they go mad. As soon as they get their hands on their money they blow it all on milk, bread, tea, tin of meat for the cat. 

<Direction: Cut to cinema.> 

Cinema Manager(Terry Jones): Yes, well of course they come here for the two o'clock matinee, all the old bags out in there, especially if it's something like 'The Sound of Music'. We get seats ripped up, hearing aids broken, all that sort of thing. 

<Direction: A policeman hustles two grannies out of the cinema. Cut to reporter walking along street.> 

Reporter(Eric Idle): The whole problem of these senile delinquents lies in their complete rejection of the values of contemporary society. They've seen their children grow up and become accountants, stockbrokers and even sociologists, and they begin to wonder if it is all really... 

<Direction: disappears downwards rapidly> 

Reporter(Eric Idle): arggh! 

<Direction: Shot of two grannies replacing manhole cover. Cut to young couple.> 

Fourth Young Man(Graham Chapman): Oh well we sometimes feel we're to blame in some way for what our gran's become. I mean she used to be happy here until she, she started on the crochet. 

<Direction: off-screen> 

Reporter(Eric Idle): Crochet? 

Fourth Young Man(Graham Chapman): Yeah. Now she can't do without it. Twenty balls of wool a day, sometimes. If she can't get the wool she gets violent. What can we do about it? 

<Direction: Film of grannies on motorbikes roaring down streets and through a shop. One has 'Hell's Grannies' on her jacket.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But this is not just an old ladies' town. There are other equally dangerous gangs - such as the baby snatchers. 

<Direction: Film of five men in baby outfits carrying off a young man from outside a shop. Cut to distraught wife.> 

Wife(Rita Davies): I just left my husband out here while I went in to do some shopping and I came back and he was gone. He was only forty-seven. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And on the road too, vicious gangs of keep left signs. 

<Direction: Film: two keep-left signs attack a vicar. coming up and stopping them> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): Right, right, stop it. This film's got silly. Started off with a nice little idea about grannies attacking young men, but now it's got silly. This man's hair is too long for a vicar too. These signs are pretty badly made. Right, now for a complete change of mood. 

<Direction: Cut to man in dirty raincoat.>

Guitarist & Dancer(None): Llamas are larger than frogs. 

Man(John Cleese): Llamas are dangerous, so if you see one where people are swimming, you shout... 

Guitarist & Dancer(None): Look out, there are llamas! 

<Direction: Graham dressed in a spanish frock, enters on a moped; he blows up a paper bag and bursts it. They bow. Cut to exterior Ada's Snack Bar (a small cafe). Hand-held camera moves round the back to where an announcer is seated at desk with an old-fashioned BBC microphone.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now for something completely different - a man with a tape recorder up his nose. 

<Direction: We see Michael, in evening dress, on a small stage, with potted plants, etc. He ostentatiously inserts a finger up one nostril. We hear the Marseillaise. He removes the finger; the music stops. He inserts the finger up the other nostril: we hear rewinding noises. Once again he inserts a finger up the first nostril: again we hear the Marseillaise. He bows. Stock film of Women's Institute applauding. He inserts a finger up his nostril again, and we hear:>

Bob(Eric Idle): Seat? 

Sir(John Cleese): Seat! Take a seat. So! 

<Direction: looking over to Bob's right keeps looking off to right rather uncertain> 

Bob(Eric Idle): Me, sir? 

Sir(John Cleese): Yes. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Yes, I'd very much like to, sir. 

Sir(John Cleese): Jolly good, jolly good. 

<Direction: he ticks the sheet and then looks straight at Bob> 

Sir(John Cleese): And how about you? 

<Direction: putting hand over eye and looking both at Bob and to Bob's right he tears up form> 

Sir(John Cleese): Now let me fill you in. I'm leading this expedition and we're going to climb both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro. 

Bob(Eric Idle): I thought there was only one peak, sir. 

<Direction: getting up, putting one hand over one eye again and going to large map of Africa on wall and peering at it at point-blank range> 

Sir(John Cleese): Well, that'll save a bit of time. Well done. Now the object of this expedition is to see if we can find any traces of last year's expedition. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Last year's expedition? 

Sir(John Cleese): Yes, my brother was leading that, they were going to build a bridge between the two peaks, 

<Direction: looks at map with one hand over eye> 

Sir(John Cleese): My idea I'm afraid. Now, I ought to tell you that I have practically everyone I need for this expedition ... so what special qualifications do you have? 

Bob(Eric Idle): Well, sir... 

Sir(John Cleese): Yes, you first. 

<Direction: to Bob's right to Bob> 

Sir(John Cleese): Carry on. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Well I'm a fully qualified mountaineer. 

Sir(John Cleese): Mountaineer? Mountaineer 

<Direction: looks it up in the dictionary> 

Sir(John Cleese): where the devil are they, mound, mount... mountain... a mountaineer: 'two men skilled in climbing mountains'. Jolly good, well you're in. Congratulations, both of you. Well, er, what are your names? 

Bob(Eric Idle): Arthur Wilson. 

Sir(John Cleese): Arthur Wilson, right well look, I'll call you 

Sir(John Cleese): Arthur Wilson two, just to avoid confusion. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Are you actually leading this expedition sir? 

Sir(John Cleese): Yes, we are leading this expedition to Africa. 

Bob(Eric Idle): And what routes will you both be taking? 

Sir(John Cleese): Good questions... shall I? Well we'll be leaving on January 22nd and taking the following routes. 

<Direction: goes over to large map, clearly labelled Surrey> 

Sir(John Cleese): The A23s through Purleys down on the main roads near Purbrights avoiding Leatherheads and then taking the A231s entering Rottingdeans from the North. From Rottingdeans we go through Africa to Nairobis. We take the South road out of Nairobis for about twelve miles and then ask. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Does anyone speak Swahili, sir? 

Sir(John Cleese): Oh, yes I think most of them do down there. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Does anyone in our party speak Swahili sir? 

Sir(John Cleese): Oh, well Matron's got a smattering. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Apart from the two Matrons ... 

Sir(John Cleese): Good God, I'd forgotten about her. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Apart from them, who else is coming on the expedition, sir? 

Sir(John Cleese): Well we've got the Arthur Brown twins, two botanists called Machin, the William Johnston brothers ... 

Bob(Eric Idle): Two of them? 

Sir(John Cleese): No four of them, a pair of identical twins ... and a couple of the Ken Spinoza quads - the other two pulled out. And of course you two. 

Bob(Eric Idle): And none of these are mountaineers? 

Sir(John Cleese): Well you two are, and we've got a brace of guides called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky climb you know, most of it's up until you reach the very very top, and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his heads together and worked out a way up. 

<Direction: opens door Jimmy walks in wearing full climbing gear> 

Sir(John Cleese): I don't believe you've met. Jimmy Blenkinsop - Arthur Wilson, Arthur Wilson -Jimmy Blenkinsop... Arthur Wilson two -James Blenkinsop one, James Blenkinsop one - Arthur Wilson two. Carry on Jimmies. 

<Direction: to Bob, reassuring him puts hand over eye Jimmy proceeds to walk round the room clambering over every single piece of available furniture. He doesn't stop talking. Causing a complete wreckage, he clambers over the desk, onto a bookcase and round the room knocking furniture over, meanwhile he is saying.. Now the approach to Kilimanjaro is quite simply over the foothills, and then we go on after that to ... ohh... to set a base camp, somewhere in the region of the bottom of the glacier when... Jimmy staggers out headlong through the door. There are loud crashing noises> 

Sir(John Cleese): He'll be leading the first assault. 

Bob(Eric Idle): Well I'm afraid I shan't be coming on your expedition sir, as I've absolutely no confidence in anyone involved in it. 

<Direction: Bob gets up and walks out slamming the door.> 

Sir(John Cleese): Oh dear. 

<Direction: pause - look over at other? Bob> 

Sir(John Cleese): Well how about you? 

<Direction: sitting in chair at other angle of desk> 

Bob(Eric Idle): Well I'm game, sir. 

<Direction: Cut back to two sirs, double image, split screen.> 

Sir(John Cleese): So are we. 

<Direction: Cut to two announcers (Johns) at desks. They put telephones down, turns to camera, and announce:> 

Announcers(John Cleese): And now for aomething completely different - a man with a tape recorder up his brother's nose. 

<Direction: Cut to Michael on small stage as before, this time also with Graham. Michael puts a finger up Graham's nostril: we hear the Marseillaise. He removes it: the music stops. He puts a finger up Graham's other nostril, and we hear rewinding noises. and CAPTION:> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): 'AND NOW IN STEREO...' 

<Direction: Michael simultaneously puts a finger up his own nostril and a finger (on the other hand) up Graham's; we hear two recordings of the Marseillaise together (out of sync).> 

None(None): An animated sequence then leads us to a gents suburban hairdressing salon. A customer comes in. The barber is standing in a white coat washing his hands at a basin. 

Customer(Terry Jones): Morning. 

<Direction: flinching slightly> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Ah ... good morning sir, good morning. I'll be with you in a minute. 

<Direction: Customer sits in barber's chair. Barber carries on washing. He seems to be over-thoroughly washing and rewashing his hands and lower arms. Barber turns and smiles humourlessly, at customer. At last he has finished washing. He dries his hands thoroughly, turns and comes over to the customer. There are very obvious blood stains on his coat and his lapel is torn off. One stain could be the mark of a bloodstained hand which has slipped down the length of it. He picks up a sheet and shakes it out. Sound of iron and heavy objects falling on the floor. He throws it around the customer. As he knots the sheet at the back he is about to pull it tight and strangle the customer. His face sweats, a wild look in his eyes. Then with a supreme effort he controls himself. Customer smiles reassuringly at him.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): How... how would you like it, sir? 

Customer(Terry Jones): Just short back and sides please. 

Barber(Michael Palin): How do you do that? 

Customer(Terry Jones): Well it's just... ordinary short back and sides. 

Barber(Michael Palin): It's not a ... razor cut? 

<Direction: suddenly controlling himself sigh of relief> 

Barber(Michael Palin): It's just a scissors. 

Customer(Terry Jones): Yes... 

<Direction: laughs, thinking the barber must be having a little joke> 

Barber(Michael Palin): You wouldn't rather just have it combed, would you sir? 

Customer(Terry Jones): I beg your pardon? 

Barber(Michael Palin): You wouldn't rather forget all about it? 

Customer(Terry Jones): No, no, no, I want it cut. 

<Direction: At the word cut barber winces.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Cut, cut, cut, blood, spurt, artery, murder, Hitchcock, Psycho... right sir ... well ... 

<Direction: swallows hard> 

Barber(Michael Palin): I'll just get everything ready. In the meanwhile perhaps you could fill in one of these. 

<Direction: He hands him a bit of paper; the barber goes to a cupboard and opens it.> 

Customer(Terry Jones): All right, fine, yes. 

<Direction: On the inside of the door there is a large medical chart headed: 'Main Arteries'. His shaking hand traces the arteries and he looks occasionally back at the customer.> 

Customer(Terry Jones): Excuse me, er... 

Barber(Michael Palin): What? 

Customer(Terry Jones): Where it says: 'next of kin' shall I put 'mother'? 

Barber(Michael Palin): Yes, yes ... yes. 

Customer(Terry Jones): Right there we are. 

<Direction: hands form to barber> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Thank you. 

<Direction: He gets scissors and comb ready and comes up behind the customer and spreads his arms out, opening and shutting scissors as barbers do before cutting.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Right! 

<Direction: He can't bring himself to start cutting; after one or two attempts he goes to the cupboard again, gets a whisky bottle out and takes a hard swig. He comes up behind the customer again.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Ha, ha, ha ... there, I've finished. 

Customer(Terry Jones): What? 

Barber(Michael Palin): I've finished cutting... cutting... cutting your hair. It's all done, 

Customer(Terry Jones): You haven't started cutting it! 

Barber(Michael Palin): I have! I did it very quickly... your honour... 

Barber(None): sir 

Barber(Michael Palin): ... sir... 

<Direction: getting rather testy> 

Customer(Terry Jones): Look here old fellow, I know when a chap's cut my hair and when he hasn't. So will you please stop fooling around and get on with it. 

<Direction: The barber bends down to the floor and drags out a tape recorder which he places behind the barber's chair, talking as he does so.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, I will, I'm going to cut your hair, sir. I'm going to start cutting your hair, sir, start cutting now! 

<Direction: He switches on tape recorder and then he himself cowers down against the wall as far from the chair as he can get, trembling.> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Nice day, sir, 

Customer(Terry Jones): Yes, flowers could do with a drop of rain though, eh? 

<Direction: snip, snip> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Did you see the match last night, sir? 

Customer(Terry Jones): Yes. Good game. I thought. 

<Direction: snip, snip, snip; sound of electric razor starting up> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): I thought Hurst played well sir. 

<Direction: straining to hear razor stops> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): I thought Hurst played well. 

Customer(Terry Jones): Oh yes ... yes ... he was the only one who did though. 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Can you put your head down a little, sir? 

Customer(Terry Jones): Sorry, sorry. 

<Direction: his head is bowed> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): I prefer to watch Palace nowadays. 

<Direction: electric razor starts up again> 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Oh! Sorry! Was that your ear? 

Customer(Terry Jones): No no ... I didn't feel a thing. 

<Direction: The customer rises out from his seat, taking the sheet off himself and looking in the mirror and delving into pocket. He turns round for the first time and sees the cowering barber.> 

Customer(Terry Jones): Look, what's going on? 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Yes, it's a nice spot, isn't it. 

Customer(Terry Jones): Look, I came here for a haircut! 

<Direction: pathetically> 

Barber(Michael Palin): It looks very nice sir. 

<Direction: angrily> 

Customer(Terry Jones): It's exactly the same as when I first came in. 

Tape Recorder(Michael Palin): Right, that's the lot then. 

Barber(Michael Palin): All right ... I confess I haven't cut your hair ... I hate cutting hair. I have this terrible un-un-uncontrollable fear whenever I see hair. When I was a kid I used to hate the sight of hair being cut. My mother said I was a fool. She said the only way to cure it was to become a barber. So I spent five ghastly years at the Hairdressers' Training Centre at Totnes. Can you imagine what it's like cutting the

Barber(Michael Palin): We'd sing ... sing ... sing.

<Direction: Cut to hand-written letter.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Dear Sir, I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about the song which you have just broadcast, about the lumberjack who wears women's clothes.

CompÃ¨re(Eric Idle): Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Refreshment Room here at Bletchley. 

<Direction: applause grovelling by now on his knees> 

CompÃ¨re(Eric Idle): Someone whose boots I would gladly lick clean until holes wore through my tongue, a man who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed in a pit of my own filth, than dare tread on the same stage with him.Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!

<Direction: Two animated men dance to jug band music. When they finish we cut back to the barber and customer.> 

Barber(Michael Palin): So anyway, I became a barber. 

<Direction: sympathetically> 

Customer(Terry Jones): Poor chap. 

Barber(Michael Palin): Yes, pity really, I always preferred the outdoor life. Hunting, shooting, fishing. Getting out there with a gun, slaughtering a few of God's creatures - that was the life. Charging about the moorland, blasting their heads off. 

<Direction: Cut to a large country house. A number of sportin' gentlemen dressed in huntin' tweed and carrying shotguns come out, casually firing the guns at random. They climb into a land-rover and drive off. Cut to huntin' country. A line of beater moves towards the camera; as they do so several young couples leap up out of the undergrowth and run away. Shots of hunters stalking their prey and shooting. One of them breaks his gun into two pieces. Another fires into the air. An egg lands on his head. Cut to two duellists (with pistols) and a referee standing between them. They fire; the referee falls dead. A huntin' gentleman fires into the air, falls over backwards; a young couple gets up from close behind him and run away. Another huntin' gentleman is arguing defensively with a pilot who has just landen by parachute. A hunter fires into some bushes; a Red Indian pops up and runs away in alarm. They all return to the house, legs and arms variously in plaster and bandaged. Two of them carry a pole between them from which is slung a very small bird. The picture of the outside of the house freezes and we pull back to reveal that it is a photo on a stand, by which stands the knight in armour, expectantly flexing his raw chicken. The floor manager comes up to him.> 

Floor Manager(None): I'm sorry, we don't need you this week. 

<Direction: Knight looks dejected, droops and slinks off, still holding chicken. He walks past a hen house from wherein we hear a voice.>

Iris(Carol Cleveland): Oh, do you really mean that? 

Victor(Graham Chapman): I do, I do, I do. I think... I'm beginning to fall in love with you. 

Iris(Carol Cleveland): Oh Victor. 

Victor(Graham Chapman): It's silly isn't it? 

Iris(Carol Cleveland): No, no, not at all dear sweet Victor. 

Victor(Graham Chapman): No I didn't mean that. Only just us being so close together for so many months in the soft-toy department and yet never daring to... 

Iris(Carol Cleveland): Oh, oh Victor. 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Oh Iris. 

<Direction: they move closer to kiss; just before their lips meet the doorbell rings>

Arthur(Eric Idle): Oh, blimey, it's dark in here,

Arthur(Eric Idle): that's better. Only you said we must have a drink together sometime, so I thought I'd take you up on it as the film society meeting was cancelled this evening. 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Look, to be frank, it is a little awkward this evening. 

<Direction: stepping in; to Iris> 

Arthur(Eric Idle): Hello, I'm Arthur. Arthur Name. Name by name but not by nature. I always say that, don't I Vicky boy?

Victor(Graham Chapman): I beg your pardon? 

Arthur(Eric Idle): Mind if I change the record? 

<Direction: takes the record off> 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Look, look, we put that on. 

Arthur(Eric Idle): Here's a good one, I heard it in a pub. What's brown, what's brown and sounds like a bell? 

Arthur(Eric Idle): What's brown and sounds like a bell? Dung! Ha, ha, ha, that's a good one. I like that one, I won't keep you long. 

<Direction: the gramophone plays the 'Liberty Bell March' very loud> 

Arthur(Eric Idle): That's better, now don't worry about me. I'll wait here till you've finished. 

<Direction: The doorbell rings again.> 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Who the hell... 

Arthur(Eric Idle): I'll get it. It'll be friends of mine. I took the liberty of inviting them along. 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Look, we were hoping to have a quiet evening on our own. 

Arthur(Eric Idle): Oh, they won't mind. They're very broad-minded. Hello!

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Good evening. My name is Equator, Mr Equator Equator. Like round the middle of the Earth, only with an L.

Mr Equator(John Cleese): This is my wife Audrey, she smells a bit but she has a heart of gold.

Audrey(Terry Jones): I only want three cans. 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Button your lip you rat-bag. 

<Direction: laughs uproariously joins in> 

Audrey(Terry Jones): Ha, ha, ha, ha... 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): It was rather witty, wasn't it? Where's my gin? 

<Direction: The doorbell rings again> 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Who the hell's that? 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Oh, I took the liberty of inviting an old friend along, as his wife has just passed away, and he's somewhat distraught poor chap. I hope you don't mind. 

<Direction: opening door> 

Arthur(Eric Idle): Come on in. 

<Direction: In walks Mr Freight in underpants, sequins, eye make-up, white wellies, and necklace.> 

Mr Freight(Terry Gilliam): Oh? My God, what a simply ghastly place. 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Not too good is it? A pint of crÃ¨me de menthe for my friend. Well how are you, you great poof? 

<Direction: sits down throws it into fire> 

Iris(Carol Cleveland): Aaaagh! Boo boo hooo. 

Mr Freight(Terry Gilliam): I've asked along a simply gorgeous little man I picked up outside the Odeon. 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Is he sexy? 

<Direction: In walks Mr Cook with a goat. Freight kisses him.> 

Mr Cook(Michael Palin): I had to bring the goat, he's not well. I only hope he don't go on the carpet. 

<Direction: to Iris> 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Come on then love, drop 'em. 

Iris(Carol Cleveland): Aaaaaaagh! 

<Direction: runs out> 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): Blimey, she don't go much do she. 

<Direction: He sits in chair which collapses.> 

Audrey(Terry Jones): Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, oooooh! I've wet 'em 

Mr Cook(Michael Palin): The goat's just done a bundle. 

<Direction: A group of singers run on, dressed as Welsh miners. All talk at once.> 

Victor(Graham Chapman): Look, get out all of you. Go on. Get out! Get out! 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): I beg your pardon? 

Victor(Graham Chapman): I'm turning you all out. I'm not having my house filled with filthy perverts, now look, I'm giving you just half a minute then I'm going to call the police, so get out. 

Mr Equator(John Cleese): I don't much like the tone of your voice.

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Thank you. Take the weight off the feet, eh? 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Yes, yes. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Lovely weather for the time of year, I must say. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr Anchovy, you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited for. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): That is correct, yes. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well I now have the results here of the interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person that you are. And I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): But I 

Anchovy(None): am 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): a chartered accountant. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Jolly good. Well back to the office with you then. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job. Something

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting isn't it? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Exciting? No it's 

Anchovy(None): not 

Anchovy(None): Dull 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): . My God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well, er, yes Mr Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative, timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): But don't you see, I came here to find a new job, a new life, a new 

Anchovy(None): meaning 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): to my existence. Can't you help me? 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well, do you have any idea of what you want to do? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Yes, yes I have. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): What? 

<Direction: boldly> 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Lion taming. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way 

Counsellor(None): towards 

Counsellor(John Cleese): lion taming, say, via banking? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): No, no, no, no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there, taming. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Fine, fine. But do you, do you have any qualifications? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Yes, I've got a hat. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): A hat? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after dark when they're less stroppy. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): I see, I see. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): And you can switch it off during the day time, and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional expenses under paragraph 335C... 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Yes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr Anchovy, but you see the snag is... if I now call Mr Chipperfield and say to him, 'look here, I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort of experience you've had with lions. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Well I ... I've seen them at the zoo. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Good, good, good. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): And these, er, these lions ... how high are they? 

<Direction: indicating a height of one foot> 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Well they're about so high, you know. They don't frighten me at all. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Really. And do these lions eat ants? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Yes, that's right. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Er, well, Mr Anchovy ... I'm afraid what you've got hold of there is an anteater. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): A what? 

Counsellor(John Cleese): An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look like this. 

<Direction: The counsellor produces large picture of a lion and shows to Mr Anchovy who screams and passes out.>

<Direction: Cut back to office: Mr Anchovy sits up with a start.> 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Now, shall I call Mr Chipperfield? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Er, no, no, no. I think your idea of making the transition to lion taming via easy stages, say via insurance... 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Or banking. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Or banking, yes, yes, banking that's a man's life, isn't it? Banking, travel, excitement, adventure, thrills, decisions affecting people's lives. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Jolly good, well, er, shall I put you in touch with a bank? 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Fine. 

Anchovy(Michael Palin): Er... no, no, no. Look, er, it's a big decision, I'd like a couple of weeks to think about it... er... you know, don't want to jump into it too quickly. Maybe three weeks. I could let you know definitely then, I just don't want to make this definite decision. I'm er... 

<Direction: continues muttering nervously to himsel turning to camera> 

Counsellor(John Cleese): Well this is just one of the all too many cases on our books of chartered accountancy. The only way that we can fight this terrible debilitating social disease, is by informing the general public of its consequences, by showing young people that it's just not worth it. So, so please... give generously... to this address: The League for Fighting Chartered Accountancy, 55 Lincoln House, Basil Street, London, SW3.

Unction(Graham Chapman): Oh that's not what I've heard. 

<Direction: Cut to the sea. Pan to show Ron Obvious running along beach.> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): There is an epic quality about the sea which has throughout history stirred the hearts and minds of Englishmen of all nations. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Webb, Nelson of Trafalgar and Scott of the Antartic - all rose to the challenge of the mighty ocean. And today another Englishman may add his name to the golden roll of history: Mr Ron Obvious of Neaps End. For today, Ron Obvious hopes to be the first man to jump the Channel. 

<Direction: Ron runs up to group of cheering supporters. An interviewer addresses him.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Ron, now let's just get this quite clear - you're intending to jump across the English Channel? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Oh yes, that is correct, yes. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): And, er, just how far is that? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Oh, well it's twenty-six miles from here to Calais. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, that's to the beach at Calais? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off and maybe a gust of breeze over the French coast, I shall be jumping into the centre of Calais itself. 

<Direction: Brief shot of group of Frenchmen with banner. 'Fin de Cross-Channel jump'.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Ron are you using any special techniques to jump this great distance? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Oh no, no. I shall be using an ordinary two-footed jump, er, straight up in the air and across the Channel. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): I see. Er, Ron, what is the furthest distance that you've jumped, er, so far? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Er, oh, eleven foot six inches at Motspur Park on July 22nd. Er, but I have done nearly twelve feet unofficially. 

<Direction: Ron breaks off to make training-type movements.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): I see. Er, Ron, Ron, Ron, aren't you worried Ron, aren't you worried jumping twenty-six miles across the sea? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Oh, well no, no, no, no. It is in fact easier to jump over sea than over dry land. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well how is that? 

Ron(Terry Jones): Er, well my manager explained it to me. You see if you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea underneath you, er, there is a very great impetus to say in the air. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): I see. Well, er, thank you very much Ron and the very best of luck. 

Ron(Terry Jones): Thank you. Thank you. 

<Direction: to camera turns to speak to Vercotti, who has a Mafia suit and dark glasses> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Mr Vercotti, er Mr Vercotti ... Mr Vercotti... 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): What?

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): I don't know what you're talking about. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, no, we're from the BBC, Mr Vercotti. 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Who? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): The BBC. 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Oh, oh. I see. I thought, I thought you were the er . .. I like the police a lot, I've got a lot of time for them. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Mr, er, Mr Vercotti, what is your chief task as Ron's manager? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Well my main task is, er, to fix a sponsor for the big jump. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): And who is the sponsor? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah, they, er, pay all the bills, er, in return for which Ron will be carrying half a hundredweight of their bricks. 

<Direction: We see a passport officer checking Ron's passport.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): I see. Well, er, it looks as if Ron is ready now. He's got the bricks. He's had his passport checked and he's all set to go. And he's off on the first ever cross-Channel jump. 

<Direction: Ron runs down the beach and jumps; he lands about four feet into the water> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Will Ron be trying the cross-Channel jump again soon? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps. Er, because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think is very much more up his street. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, what's that? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Er, Ron is going to eat Chichester Cathedral. 

<Direction: Cut to Chichester Cathedral. Ron walks up to it, brushing his teeth.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious of Neaps End, in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an entire Anglican Cathedral. 

<Direction: Ron takes a hefty bite at a buttress, screams and clutches his mouth. Cut to countryside: a map, and a banner saying 'Tunnelling to Java'. Interviewer and Vercotti walk up to map.> 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Well, er, I think, David, this is something which Ron and myself are really keen on. Ron is going to tunnel from Godalming here to Java here. 

<Direction: indicates inaccurately on map> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Java. 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is going to make Ron a household name overnight. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): And how far has he got? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Er, well, he's quite far now, Dave, well on the way. Well on the way, yeah. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Well where is he exactly? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Yeah. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Where? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Oh, er, well, er, you know, it's difficult to say exactly. He's er, you know, in the area of er, Ron, how far have you got?

<Direction: Cut to interviewer and Vercotti by railway track.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Er, Mr Verccotti, what do you say to people who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): Well, it's totally untrue, David. Ever since I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what Ron wants to do, I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): And what's he going to do today? 

Mr Vercotti(Michael Palin): He's going to split a railway carriage with his nose.

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Oh yeah, how about that? 

<Direction: looking in box> 

Man(John Cleese): No, that's the terrier. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Well, it's as near as dammit. 

Man(John Cleese): Well what do you mean? I want a cat. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Listen, tell you what. I'll file its legs down a bit, take its snout out, stick a few wires through its cheeks. There you are, a lovely pussy cat. 

Man(John Cleese): Its not a proper cat. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): What do you mean? 

Man(John Cleese): Well it wouldn't meow. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Well it would howl a bit. 

Man(John Cleese): No, no, no, no. Er, have you got a parrot? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No, I'm afraid not actually guv, we're fresh out of parrots. I'll tell you what though ... I'll lop its back legs off, make good, strip the fur, stick a couple of wings on and staple on a beak of your own choice. 

<Direction: taking small box and rattling it> 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): No problem. Lovely parrot. 

Man(John Cleese): How long would that take? 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Oh, let me see ... er, stripping the fur off, no legs ... 

<Direction: calling> 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Harry ... can you do a parrot job on this terrier straight away? 

<Direction: off-screen> 

Harry(Graham Chapman): No, I'm still putting a tuck in the Airedale, and then I got the frogs to let out. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Friday? 

Man(John Cleese): No I need it for tomorrow. It's a present. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): Oh dear, it's a long job. You see parrot conversion ... Tell you what though, for free, terriers make lovely fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off, fins on, stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can breathe, bit of gold paint, make good ... 

Man(John Cleese): You'd need a very big tank. 

Shopkeeper(Michael Palin): It's a great conversation piece. 

Man(John Cleese): Yes, all right, all right ... but, uh, only if I can watch.

Gorilla(Eric Idle): That's right, yes. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Er, do take a seat. 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): Right sir. 

<Direction: sits> 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Now could you tell us roughly why you want to become a librarian? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): Er, well, I've had a certain amount of experience running a library at school. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes, yes. What sort of experience? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): Er, well for a time I ran the Upper Science Library. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes, yes. Now Mr Phipps, you do realize that the post of librarian carries with it certain very important responsibilities. I mean, there's the selection of books, the record library, and the art gallery. Now it seems to me that your greatest disadvantage is your lack of professional experience ... coupled with the fact that, uh, being a gorilla, you would tend to frighten people. 

<Direction: aside> 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Is he a gorilla? 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes he is. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Well why didn't it say on his form that he's a gorilla? 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Well, you see applicants are not required to fill in their species. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): What was that picture? 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Sh! ... Mr Phipps, what is your attitude toward censorship in a public library? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): How do you mean, sir? 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Well I mean for instance, would you for instance stock 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'... or ... 'Groupie'? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): Yes, I think so. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Good. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes, well, that seems to me to be very sensible Mr Phipps. I can't pretend that this library hasn't had its difficulties ... Mr Robertson, your predecessor, an excellent librarian, savaged three people last week and had to be destroyed. 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): I'm sorry sir. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, don't be sorry. You see, I don't believe that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence, and that's been the main reason for our policy of employing wild animals as librarians. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): And also, they're much more permissive. Pumas keep Hank Janson on open shelves... 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Yes. Yes. Yes. 

<Direction: a maniacal look in his eyes collects himself> 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Mr Phipps ... Kong! You can be our next librarian - you're proud, majestic and fierce enough ... will you do it? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): I ... don't think I can sir. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Why not? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): I.. I'm not really a gorilla. 

Vicar(Terry Jones): Eh? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): I'm a librarian in a skin. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Why this deception? 

Gorilla(Eric Idle): Well, they said it was the best way to get the job. 

Chairman(Graham Chapman): Get out, Mr Librarian Phipps, seeing as you're not a gorilla, but only dressed up as one, trying to deceive us in order to further your career ...

Inspector Tiger(John Cleese): Albody me introbody albodyduce. 

<Direction: At this moment a surgeon enters with two nurses and starts to operate on his head with sawing noises. CAPTION: 'THE SAME DRAWING ROOM. ONE LOBOTOMY LATER'. The surgeon is packing up. Inspector Tiger's head is bandaged. Now for Sir Gerald.> 

Inspector(John Cleese): That's better, now I'm Inspector Tiger and I must ask that nobody leave the room. 

<Direction: he gives thumbs up to the surgeon who is at door> 

Inspector(John Cleese): Now someone has committed a murder here, and that murderer is someone in this room. The question is ... who? 

Colonel Pickering(Graham Chapman): Look, there hasn't been a murder. 

Inspector Tiger(John Cleese): No murder. 

All(None): No. 

Inspector Tiger(John Cleese): Oh. I don't like it. It's too simple, too clear cut. I'd better wait. 

<Direction: he sits on sofa> 

Inspector Tiger(John Cleese): No, too simple, too clear cut. 

<Direction: The lights go out. There is a scream followed by a shot. The light goes up. Inspector Tiger is dead. He has a bullet hole in his forehead, an arrow through his neck and there is a bottle marked poison on his lap.> 

Colonel Pickering(Graham Chapman): By jove, he was right. 

<Direction: Chief Superintendent Lookout enters, with constable.> 

Lookout(Eric Idle): This house is surrounded. I must ask that no one leave the room. I'm Chief Superintendent Lookout. 

Lady Velloper(Carol Cleveland): Look out? 

<Direction: jumping> 

Lookout(Eric Idle): What, where, oh, me, Lookout. Lookout of the Yard. 

Lady Velloper(Carol Cleveland): Why, what would we see? 

Lookout(Eric Idle): I'm sorry? 

Lady Velloper(Carol Cleveland): What would we see if we look out of the yard? 

Lookout(Eric Idle): . .. I'm afraid I don't follow that at all. Ah ha. The body. So the murderer must be somebody in this room. Unless he had very long arms. Say thirty or forty feet. I think we can discount that one. Ha, ha, ha, 

<Direction: he starts really laughing lights go out, we hear Lookout's voice scream> 

Lookout(Eric Idle): then just before the lights went up there was a shot. 

<Direction: There is a shot. The lights go up and Chief Superintendent Lookout is sitting dead, bullet hole, arrow and all. In walks Assistant Chief Constable Theresamanbehindyer.> 

Theresamanbehindyer(Terry Jones): All right... all right, the house is surrounded and nobody leave the room and all the rest of it. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Assistant Chief Constable Theresamanbehindyer. 

All(None): Theresamanbehindyer? 

Theresamanbehindyer(Terry Jones): Ah, you're not going to catch me with an old one like that. Right let's reconstruct the crime. Constable you be Inspector Tiger. 

Constable(Michael Palin): Right, sir. Nobody leave the room ask shall - somebody I leave nobody in the room body shall, take the tablets Tigerbody. Alself me to my duce introlow left body in the roomself. 

Theresamanbehindyer(Terry Jones): Very good. Just sit down there. Right now we'll pretend the lights have gone out. Constable, you scream. 

<Direction: constable screams pulls gun and shoots constable through head> 

Theresamanbehindyer(Terry Jones): and the door opens... 

<Direction: The door flies open. Enter policeman. Nobody move! I'm Chief Constable Fire. Fire! Where? He jumps. Immediately cut to undertaker as before.> 

Second Undertaker(Terry Jones): We're interrupting this sketch but we'll be bringing you back the moment anything interesting happens. Meanwhile here are some friends of mine. 

<Direction: Film of four undertakers carrying a coffin. They surreptitiously tip the body out of the coffin and go skipping lightly up the road. Letter and voice over.> 

Voice Over(Graham Chapman): Dear Sir, I'm sorry this letter is late, it should have come at the beginning of the programme. Yours, Ivor Bigbottie, (age two). 

<Direction: Two chairs in interview set. Smart interviewer and footballer (who is not over bright) in blazer.> 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): From the plastic arts we turn to football. Last night in the Stadium of Light, Jarrow, we witnessed the resuscitation of a great footballing tradition, when Jarrow United came of age, in a European sense, with an almost Proustian display of modern existentialist football. Virtually annihilating by midfield moral argument the now surely obsolescent catennachio defensive philosophy of Signor Alberto Fanffino. Bologna indeed were a side intellectually out argued by a Jarrow team thrusting and bursting with aggressive Kantian positivism and outstanding in this fine Jarrow team was my man of the match, the arch-thinker, free scheming, scarcely ever to be curbed, midfield cognoscento, Jimmy Buzzard. 

Buzzard(John Cleese): Good evening Brian. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Jimmy, at least one ageing football commentator was gladdened last night by the sight of an English footballer breaking free of the limpid tentacles of packed Mediterranean defence. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Were you surprised at the way the Italians ceded midfield dominance so early on in the game? 

Buzzard(John Cleese): Well Brian... I'm opening a boutique. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): This is of course symptomatic of a new breed of footballer as it is indeed symptomatic of your whole genre of player, is it not? 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): What I'm getting at, Jimmy, is you seem to have discovered a new concept with a mode in which you dissected the Italian defence, last night. 

<Direction: pauses for thought smiles and looks around> 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Do you think Jarrow will adopt a more defensive posture for the first leg of the next tie in Turkey? 

<Direction: confidently> 

Buzzard(John Cleese): I hit the ball first time and there it was in the back of the net. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Yes, yes - but have you any plans for dealing with the free-scoring Turkish forwards? 

<Direction: Cut to undertaker.> 

Second Undertaker(Terry Jones): And now let's take a look at the state of play in the detective sketch. 

<Direction: Cut to drawing room. There is an enormous pile of dead policemen from the Agatha Christie Sketch on and around the sofa. Alself me to introlow mybody... Inspector shoots him in the head. CAPTION: 'CONSTABLES 13 SUPERINTENDENTS 9' Cut to four undertakers carrying a coffin up a hill. One of them falters and drops. The others lower the coffin to the ground, take out a fresh undertaker, put the fallen one in the coffin, and proceed. Cut to animated sequence, leadning to big glittering flashing lights saying 'Interesting People'. A compÃ¨re sits at desk, with guest chairs beside it.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Hello, good evening, and welcome to yet another edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person tonight is the highly interesting Mr Howard Stools from Kendal in Westmorland. 

<Direction: He puts a matchbox on desk in front of him. He presses a button on the desk and we hear applause. Releases button; applause stops abruptly. He opens the box a little and speaks into it.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Good evening Mr Stools. 

<Direction: from inside box Hello, David.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Mr Stools, what makes you particularly interesting? 

Voice(None): Well, I'm only half an inch long. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well that's 

CompÃ¨re(None): extremely 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): interesting, thank you for coming along on the show tonight Mr Stools. 

Mr Stools(None): I thought you'd think that was interesting David, in fact... 

<Direction: shuts matchbox; applause applause> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Our next guest tonight has come all the way from Egypt, he's just flown into London today, he's Mr Ali Bayan, he's with us in the studio tonight and he's stark raving mad. 

<Direction: Applause. Cut to Ali Bayan who looks at camera in a very mad way. Applause.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Mr Ali Bayan, stark raving mad. Now it's time for our music spot and we turn the spotlight tonight on the Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir, 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): with their fantastic arrangement of 'Men of Harlech' for bicycle bells only. 

<Direction: Cut to six men in oilskins and sou'westers. They sing 'Men of Harlech ', and at the end of each line mournfully ring bells. Applause at end.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): The Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir. Really interesting. Remember, if you're interesting and want to appear on this programme, write your name and address and your telephone number and send it to this address:

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Thank you, thank you. Now here's an interesting person. Apart from being a full-time stapling machine, he can also give a cat influenza. 

<Direction: Cut to a smart dressed man who coughs into a cat basket. We hear a meow and a feline sneeze. Cut back to compÃ¨re.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well, you can't get much more interesting than that, or can you? With me now is Mr Thomas Walters of West Hartlepool who is totally invisible. Good evening, Mr Walters. 

<Direction: turns to empty chair off-screen> 

Walters(Eric Idle): Over here, Hughie. 

None(None): CompÃ¨re turns to find a boringly dressed man sitting by him. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Mr Walters, are you sure you're invisible? 

Walters(Eric Idle): Oh yes, most certainly. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well, Mr Walters, what's it like being invisible? 

<Direction: slowly and boringly> 

Walters(Eric Idle): Well, for a start, at the office where I work I can be sitting at my desk all day and the others totally ignore me. At home, even though we are in the same room, my wife does not speak to me for hours, people pass me by in the street without a glance in my direction, and I can walk into a room without... 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well, whilst we've got interesting people, we met Mr Oliver Cavendish who... 

<Direction: droning on> 

Walters(Eric Idle): ... Even now you yourself, you do hardly notice me... 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Mr Oliver Cavendish of Leicester, who claims to be able to recite the entire Bible in one second, whilst being struck on the head with a large axe. Ha, ha, wow. We've since discovered that he was a fraud, yes a fraud, he did not in fact recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words, 'In the...' before his death. 

<Direction: Cut to film montage of sporting clips. voice over> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Now it's time for 'Interesting Sport', and this week it's all-in cricket, live from the Municipal Baths, Croydon. 

<Direction: Boxing ring; two fully kitted out cricketers, who as the bell goes, approach each other and start hitting each other with cricket bats. Applause.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): With me now is Mr Ken Dove, twice voted the most interesting man in Dorking. Ken, I believe you're interested in shouting. 

<Direction: shouting> 

Dove(John Cleese): Yes, I'm interested in shouting all right, by jove you certainly hit the nail on the head with that particular observation of yours then. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): What does your wife think of this? 

<Direction: voice off, full-blooded I agree with him.> 

Dove(John Cleese): Shut up! 

Walters(Eric Idle): ... At parties for instance people never come up to me, I just sit there and everybody totally... 

<Direction: Man holding cat enters.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): That is Tiddles, I believe? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Yes, this is, this is Tiddles. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Yes, and what does she do? 

Man(Graham Chapman): She flies across the studio and lands in a bucket of water. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): By herself? 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, I fling her. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well that's extremely interesting, Ladies and gentlemen - Mr Don Savage and Tiddles. 

<Direction: Man whirls the cat round and round. He lets go of the cat, it flies across studio. A hollow splash and a meow. Quick shot of a real cat sitting in a bucket.> 

Dove(John Cleese): I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat. 

Walters(Eric Idle): ... for hour after hour... 

<Direction: we see only his empty chair> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Yes, great, well now for the first lime on television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala. 

<Direction: Maniac is sitting by compÃ¨re. He wears a top hat and an opera cloak.> 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): Good evening. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep. 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): Yes, that is correct, I can... 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Entirely by hypnosis. 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): Yes ... I use no artificial means, whatsoever. 

<Direction: leans and picks matchbox off desk to light pipe, opens it and strikes match from matchbox Aaagh!> 

Dove(John Cleese): You've injured Mr Stools! 

<Direction: picks up other box and lights pipe> 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): I simply stare at the brick and it goes to sleep. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Well, we have a brick here, Keith. 

<Direction: indicates brick on desk> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Perhaps you can send it to sleep for us... 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): Oh ... Ah, well, I am afraid that is already asleep. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): How do you know? 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): Well, it's not moving .... 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Oh, I see - have we got a moving brick? Yes, we've got a moving brick, Keith, it's coming over now. 

<Direction: We see a man in a white coat preparing to throw brick. He throws it gently. It lands on the desk in front of Keith. Keith stares at it as it falls.> 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): There we are, fast asleep. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Very good, very good indeed. 

Maniac(Graham Chapman): All done with the eyes. 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Yes, Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala. 

<Direction: distressed - to matchbox> 

Dove(John Cleese): Mr Stools - speak to me, Howard. 

<Direction: Quick cut back to all-in cricket.> 

CompÃ¨re(Michael Palin): Mr Keith Maniac of Guatemala... and now four tired undertakers. 

<Direction: Cut to film of four undertakers struggling up a hill carrying a coffin. One staggers and drops. The others lower the coffin, pick him up, and place him inside. Raising the coffin again they stagger off up the hill. Another undertaker collapses; the remaining two place him in the coffin. Exhaustedly they pick up the coffin, but have only gone two or three paces when one of them collapses. The remaining one drags him into the coffin, pushing him in with some difficulty, and forces the lid shut. He debates with himself for a moment on how to pick up the coffin, then disgustedly throws away his hat and climbs into the coffin, shutting the lid behind him. The coffin moves off by itself.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): We interrupt this very quickly to take you back to the Jimmy Buzzard interview, where we understand something exciting's just happened. 

<Direction: Cut back to the interview studio; Jimmy Buzzard is sitting on the floor.> 

Buzzard(John Cleese): I've fallen off my chair, Brian. 

<Direction: Cut to a graveyard. The coffin, still moving of its own volition, enters the graveyard. A vicar walks up and motions gravediggers who we cannot see to get out of the grave. Out of the grave climb two gravediggers. . . then two more... then two more... yet another two... two miners ... two uniformed men... a police dog with handler... and finally an Australian surfboarder. The coffin makes its way into the grave. Then a wonderful piece of animation by the amazing animator Terry Gilliam, wonderboy. Consisting of a very fast collage of extremely sexy stills of half-dressed and naked girls. Incredibly torchy music, after eight seconds of which: SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE WORLD OF HISTORY' SECOND CAPTION: 'SOCIAL LEGISLATION IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY' Cut to fantastically alluring boudoir: a plush four poster bed with silk drapes, silk sheets, a fur pillow etc. We look down on it from above. Stretched out on the bed is a girl (Carol) oozing with sex... a real professional... black net stocking, suspenders, bra and panties or what have you. She moves as if in the throes of orgasm as she mimes to a very masculine voice off. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A. J. P. TAYLOR' very masculine voice to which girl mimes> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Good evening. Tonight I want to examine the whole question of eighteenth-century social legislation - its relevance to the hierarchical structure of post-Renaissance society, and its impact on the future of parochial organization in an expanding agrarian economy. But first a bit of fun. 

<Direction: Cut to film of eight-second striptease. Cut immediately back to the same set.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): To put England's social legislation in a European context is Professor Gert Van Der Whoops of the Rijksmuseum in the Hague. 

<Direction: Cut to another bed, equally seductive. A little bespectcled professor is lying on it being caressed and undressed by an amorous siren. German accent grabs girl A curtain and potted palms. Sound effects: angel choirs. A man in dinner jacket with angel's wings on is lowered from above. As he touches the ground the angel choirs fade out. He gets a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket.>

<Direction: He folds up the paper and puts it away. The angel choirs start again and he slowly rises up and out of frame. Cut to Professor Canning in straight presentation-type set with BP screen behind him. CAPTION: 'PROFESSOR R. J. CANNING AGAIN'> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): The cat sat on the mat. And now the Battle of Trafalgar... 

<Direction: on the screen behind him a contemporary piaure of the Battle of Trafalgar flashes up> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): Tonight we examine popular views of this great battle. Was the Battle of Trafalgar fought in the Atlantic off southern Spain? Or was it fought on dry land near Cudworth in Yorkshire? Here is one man who thinks it was... 

<Direction: Cut to a man - a Gumby - with gum boots on, rolled up trousers, knotted handkerchief etc., looking very thick and standing in the middle of a field. voice over> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): And here is his friend. 

<Direction: Camera pans lightly losing Gumby but revealing identically dressed thick man standing next to him. The camera pans back to original Gumby. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'PROFFESOR R. J. GUMBY'> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): What makes you think the Battle of Trafalgar was fought near Cudworth? 

<Direction: There is a long pause.> 

First Gumby(Michael Palin): Because ... Drake ... was ... too ... clever for... the German ... fleet. 

Canning(Graham Chapman): I beg your pardon? 

First Gumby(Michael Palin): ... Oh I've forgotten what I said now. 

Canning(Graham Chapman): Mr Gumby's remarkable views have sparked off a wave of controversy amongst his fellow historians. 

<Direction: Cut to identical Gumby figure in book lined study. He stands. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'F. H. GUMBY. REGIUS PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT HIS MOTHER'S'>

<Direction: brandishing egg-whisk> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): twelve and six... in a plain wrapper. 

<Direction: Cut back to Canning.> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): The stuff of history is indeed woven in the woof. Pearl Harbour. There are pages in history's book which are written on the grand scale. Events so momentous that they dwarf man and time alike. And such is the Battle of Pearl Harbour, re-enacted for us now by the women of Barley Townswomen's Guild. 

<Direction: Cut to a muddy corner of a field. Miss Rita Fairbanks stands talking straight to camera. Behind her lurk five more pepperpots.> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): Miss Rita Fairbanks - you organized this reconstruction of the Battle of Pearl Harbour - why? 

Rita(Eric Idle): Well we've always been extremely interested in modern drama ... we were of course the first Townswomen's Guild to perform 'Camp On Blood Island', and last year we did our extremely popular re-enactment of 'Nazi War Atrocities'. So this year we thought we would like to do something in a lighter vein... 

Canning(Graham Chapman): So you chose the Battle of Pearl Harbour? 

Rita(Eric Idle): Yes, that's right, we did. 

Canning(Graham Chapman): Well I can see you're all ready to go. So I'll just wish you good luck in your latest venture. 

Rita(Eric Idle): Thank you very much, young man. 

<Direction: She retreats, and joins the other ladies who meanwhile separate into two opposing sides facing each other. reverential voice over> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): Ladies and gentlemen, the World of History is proud to present the premiere of the Batley Townswomen's Guild's re-enactment of 'The Battle of Pearl Harbour'. 

<Direction: A whistle blows and the two sides set about each other with handbags etc., speeded up 50% just to give it a bit of edge. Cut to Canning in studio.> 

Canning(Graham Chapman): The Battle of Pearl Harbour. Incidentally, I'm sorry if I got a little bit shirty earlier on in the programme, when I kept getting interrupted by all these films and things that kept coming in, but I... 

<Direction: Cut to vicar in a graveyard He sprinkles dirt and gets mud thrown in his face. Vicar shoots a gun. Cut to undertakers leaving graveyard. They get into a hearse. As they leave it and drive off we see the other side is painted with psychedelic flowers. Cut to Canning.>

Presenter(Michael Palin): Good evening. Tonight 'Spectrum' looks at one of the major problems in the world today - that old vexed question of what is going on. Is there still time to confront it, let alone solve it, or is it too late? What are the figures, what are the facts, what do people mean when they talk about things? Alexander Hardacre of the Economic Affairs Bureau. 

<Direction: Cut to equally intense pundit in front of a graph with three different coloured columns with percentages at the top. He talks with great authority.> 

Hardacre(Graham Chapman): In this graph, this column represents 23% of the population. This column represents 28% of the population, and this column represents 43% of the population. 

<Direction: Cut back to presenter.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Telling figures indeed, but what do they mean to you, what do they mean to me, what do they mean to the average man in the street? With me now is Professor Tiddles of Leeds University... 

<Direction: Pull out to reveal bearded professor sitting next to presenter.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): ... Professor, you've spent many years researching into things, what do you think? 

Professor(John Cleese): I think it's too early to tell. 

<Direction: Cut to presenter, he talks even faster now.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): 'Too early to tell' ... too early to say... it means the same thing. The word 'say' is the same as the word 'tell'. They're not spelt the same, but they mean the same. It's an identical situation, we have with 'ship' and 'boat' 

<Direction: holds up signs saying 'ship' and 'boat' holds up signs he holds up signs saying 'so there'> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): But the real question remains. What is the solution, if any, to this problem? What can we do? What am I saying? Why am I sitting in this chair? Why am I on this programme? And what am I going to say next? Here to answer this is a professional cricketer. 

<Direction: Cut to cricketer.> 

Cricketer(Eric Idle): I can say nothing at this point. 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well, you were wrong... Professor? 

<Direction: Pull out to reveal professor still next to him.> 

Professor(John Cleese): Hello. 

<Direction: Cut to close-up of presenter.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Hello. So... where do we stand? Where do we stand? Where do we sit? Where do we come? Where do we go? What do we do? What do we say? What do we eat? What do we drink? What do we think? What do we do?

Landlady(Terry Jones): Well come on in, excuse me not shaking hands, I've just been putting a bit of lard on the cat's boil. 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Very nice. 

Landlady(Terry Jones): Well you must be tired, it's a long way from Coventry, isn't it? 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Well, we usually reckon on five and a half hours and it took us six hours and fifty-three minutes, with the twenty-five minute stop at Frampton Cottrell to stretch our legs, only we had to wait half an hour to get onto the M5 at Droitwich. 

Landlady(Terry Jones): Really? 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Then there was a three mile queue just before Bridgewater on the A38. We usually come round on the B3339 just before Bridgewater, you see... 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Ye, but this time we decided to risk it because they're always saying they're going to widen it there. 

Landlady(Terry Jones): Are they? 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Yes well just by the intersection, there where the A372 joins up, there's plenty of room to widen it there, there's only grass verges. They could get another six feet...knock down that hospital... Then we took the coast road through Williton and got all the Taunton traffic on the A358 from Crowcombe and Stogumber... 

Landlady(Terry Jones): Well you must be dying for a cup of tea. 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Well, wouldn't say no, not if it's warm and wet. 

Landlady(Terry Jones): Well come on in the lounge, I'm just going to serve afternoon tea.

First Robert(Terry Jones): Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall last March? 

Second Robert(Eric Idle): Er, well they fell nearly thirty-nine miles but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined weight, of course. Robert. 

First Robert(Terry Jones): Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your reaction to all this, Robert? 

<Direction: Cut to third Robert who is staring intently into camera. He is wearing a fright wig and has a left eyebrow four inches above his right one.> 

Third Robert(John Cleese): Well, well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little.

Oh I don't think it's a proper restaurant unless they give you finger bowls. Oo I don't like him. I'm going to have a baby in a few years. 

He(John Cleese): Er, please excuse my wife. She may appear to be rather nasty but underneath she has a heart of formica. 

<Direction: the waiter grimaces> 

He(John Cleese): I'm sorry about that. 

Waiter(Terry Jones): That's all right sir, we get all sorts of lines in here. The head waiter will be along to abuse you in a few moments, and now if you'll excuse me I have to go and commit suicide. 

He(John Cleese): Oh I'm sorry. 

Waiter(Terry Jones): It's all right. It's not because of anything serious. 

<Direction: He exits. Shot off-screen and scream.> 

She(Eric Idle): Quite frankly I'm against people who commit suicide, I don't like that sort of person at all. I'm plain people and I'm proud of it, my mother's the salt of the earth, and I don't take the pill 'cos it's nasty. 

<Direction: The head waiter comes in.> 

He(John Cleese): Please excuse my wife, she may not be very beautiful, and she may have no money, and she may be a little talentless, boring and dull, but on the other hand ... 

<Direction: long pause> 

He(John Cleese): ... sorry I can't think of anything. 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): Fine. I'm the head waiter. This is a vegetarian restaurant only, we serve no animal flesh of any kind. We're not only proud of that, we're smug about it. So if you were to come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken, so you could chew its skin and eat its intestines, then I'm afraid I'd have to ask you to leave. 

He(John Cleese): No, no, no, no. 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): Likewise if you were to ask us to slice the sides of a cow and serve it with small pieces of its liver ... 

<Direction: small tic developing, getting carried away reaction> 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): Not for food anyway. 

She(Eric Idle): Quite frankly I'm against people who give vent to their loquacity by extraneous bombastic circumlocution. 

<Direction: they both look at her; pause> 

She(Eric Idle): Oh I don't like that. 

He(John Cleese): Sometimes Shirley I think you're almost human. 

<Direction: thinking> 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): Do you know I still wet my bed? 

He(John Cleese): Once I married someone who was beautiful, and young, and gay, and free. Whatever happened to her? 

She(Eric Idle): You divorced her and married me. 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): I met my second wife at a second-wife-swapping party. Trust me to arrive late. 

<Direction: Enter headmaster.> 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Always were late weren't you Thompson? 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): Hello Headmaster. What are you doing here? 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Fine, fine, fine, thank you. Fine, thank you. No more sherry for me don't you know. Warner House beat Badger House for the Second Cuppa, remarkable. We had to put most of the second form to sleep. No padre. Bad business. They were beginning to play with themselves. Still... You haven't seen my wife anywhere have you? 

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): No. 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Oh thank God for that. 

<Direction: exits> 

She(Eric Idle): Oh I don't like him. Do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. I mean do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. I mean do you know what I mean. All men are the same.

Head Waiter(Michael Palin): No it doesn't. 

Prologue(None): Sorry.

In your plan, 'A Better Britain For Us', you claimed that you would build 88,000 million, billion houses a year in the Greater London area alone. In fact, you've built only three in the last fifteen years. Are you a bit disappointed with this result? 

Minister(Graham Chapman): No, no. I'd like to answer this question if I may in two ways. Firstly in my normal voice and then in a kind of silly high-pitched whine... You see housing is a problem really... 

<Direction: Cut back to the interviewer. The minister is heard droning on in the background. The soft fashion-parade music starts again.> 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Well, while the minister is answering this question I'd just like to point out the minister's dress has been made entirely by hand from over three hundred pieces of Arabian shot silk 

<Direction: at this point we can hear the minister's high-pitched whine beneath the fashion music> 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): especially created for the minister by Vargar's of Paris. The low slim-line has been cut off-the-shoulder to heighten the effect of the minister's fine bone structure. Well I think the minister is coming to the end of his answer now so let's go back over and join the discussion. Thank you very much minister. Today saw the appointment of a new head of... 

Minister(Graham Chapman): Don't I say any more? 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): No fear! Today saw the appointment of a new head of Allied Bomber Command - Air Chief Marshal Sir Vincent 'Kill the Japs' Forster. He's in our Birmingham studio... 

<Direction: Cut to close-up on what appears to be a monitor with Sir Vincent on it in outrageous drag, heavy lipstick, big bust etc. - Draped on a chaise-longue. A small black boy is fanning him.> 

Sir Vincent(John Cleese): Hello Sailors! Listen, guess what. The Minister of Aviation has made me head of the RAF Ola Pola. 

<Direction: As he talks we zoom out quickly from the set to reveal it is not a monitor in the studio but a TV set in a G-plan type sitting room. A housewife (Mrs Pinnet) sits watching, wearing an apron and a scarf and with her hair in curlers. The doorbell sounds. She switches the TV off and answers the door which opens straight into the living room. There in the street stands a truly, amazing figure of fun. A man in a bowler hat with an axe sticking out of it, big red joke nose, illuminated bow tie that revolves, joke broad shoulders, clown's check jacket, long johns with sock suspenders, heavy army boots and leading a goat with a hat. Close-up.> 

Man(None): Hello. Mrs Rogers? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): No. Ooh I must be in the wrong house, 

<Direction: She shuts the door on him and we follow her as she crosses the room. She climbs out of the window. Back yard of terraced house. She scrambles over a quite high dividing wall into next door and starts to scramble into next-door window. Interior of a more cluttered working-dass sitting-room. There is a TV in there with Sir Vincent still camping it up.> 

Sir Vincent(John Cleese): So from now on we're going to do things my way. For a start David Hockney is going to design the bombs. And I've seen the plans... 

<Direction: The doorbell rings.> 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): That must be the new gas cooker. 

<Direction: She switches the TV off. Immediate thunderous epic music. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: in stone lettering, as for Ben Hur Both caption and music switch off suddenly as she opens the door. Outside the door are two gas men with a new cooker.> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Morning. Mrs G. Crump? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): No - Mrs G. Pinnet. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): This is 46 Egernon Crescent? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): No - Road. Egernon Road. 

<Direction: looks at a bit of paper> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Road, yes, says here. Yeah. Right, could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Oh there's nobody here of that name. It's Mrs G. Pinnet. 46 Egernon Road. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it, Harry? 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Yeah - it's on the invoice. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Yeah, definitely Crump. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Well there must have been a mistake, because the address is right, and that's definitely the cooker I ordered - a blue and white CookEasi. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well you can't have this. This is Crump. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Oh dear, what are we going to do? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well I don't know. What we can do for you is take it back to the Depot, get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet, and put it on a special delivery. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Yeah - that's best. We'll special it for you, we'll get it down there today and you'll get it back in ten weeks. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this one? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): What this? What leave it here? 

<Direction: they seem thunderstruck> 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Yes. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well I dunno. I suppose we could. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Oh, but she'd have to fill out a temporary despatch note. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Yeah we could leave it on a temporary despatch note. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Well that's sorted out then. What a mess, isn't it. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): I know, it's ridiculous really, but there you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right, would you sign it down there please, Mrs Crump? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Pinnet. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Pinnet. Listen, just for the books make it a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Right. 

<Direction: she signs> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Right. Thank you very much, dear. The cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much, dear. Right. 

<Direction: they push it just inside the door and move off> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Sorry about the bother... but there you are ... you know ... cheerio! 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Cheerio, Mrs Crump! 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Heh, excuse me! Cooey! Er, can you put it in the kitchen? 

<Direction: coming back> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): You what? 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected up. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Oh we didn't realize you had an installation invoice. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): An MI. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No, we can't touch it without an MI, you see. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Or an R16. 

<Direction: who is suddenly revealed behind the two of them> 

Third Gas Man(John Cleese): If it's a special. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Nah - it's not special ... the special's back at the Depot. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No, the special's the same as installation invoice. 

Third Gas Man(John Cleese): So it's an R16. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): What's an installation invoice? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): A pink form from Reading. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Oh - we wondered what that was. Now these are the forms. 

<Direction: she produces a large wad of papers, sorts through and products a pink form which she hands to them> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): That's the one, love. Yeah, this should be all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): That's right. I'm Mrs G. Pinnet. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Well shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No, no, no - not an MI - no. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): No - that's from Area Service at Reading. 

<Direction: suddenly revealed> 

Fourth Gas Man(Eric Idle): No, Cheltenham isn't it? 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): No, not this side of the street. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Look I just want it connected up. 

<Direction: Much doubtfulness.> 

Third Gas Man(John Cleese): What about London Office? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Well they haven't got the machinery. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Not now. 

<Direction: suddenly, revealed> 

Fifth Gas Man(Terry Gilliam): What! The Hounslow Depot? 

Fourth Gas Man(Eric Idle): No - they're still on standard pressure. 

<Direction: suddenly revealed Same with Twickenham.> 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): But surely they can connect up a gas cooker? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love, but not unless it's an emergency. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): But this 

Mrs Pinnet(None): is 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): an emergency. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Yeah, it's like a leak. 

<Direction: Seventh gas man is revealed. Yeah, or a 478.> 

Third Gas Man(John Cleese): No - that's valve adjustment. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): But there can't be a leak unless you've connected it up. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No, quite. We'd have to turn it on. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Well can't you turn it on 

Mrs Pinnet(None): and 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): connect it up? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): No. But what we can do, and this is between you and me, I shouldn't really be telling you this, we'll turn your gas on, make a hole in your pipe, you ring Hounslow emergency, they'll be around here in a couple of days. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): What, a house full of gas! I'll be dead by then 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Oh well, in that case you'd have the South East Area Manager round here like a shot. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Really? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes', you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Yes. That's murder you see. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Or suicide. 

Fifth Gas Man(Terry Gilliam): No. That's S42. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Oh. 

<Direction: Eighth gas man is revealed. Still? I thought it was Hainault.> 

Fifth Gas Man(Terry Gilliam): No - Central area and Southall Marketing Division, they're both on the S42 now. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): And they'd be able to connect it up? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Oh - they'd do the lot for you, love. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): And they'd come round this afternoon? 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): ... Well what is it now... 11:30... murder... they'll be round here by two. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): Oh well that's wonderful. 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Oh well, right love, if you'd like to lie down here. 

Mrs Pinnet(Terry Jones): All right. 

<Direction: she does so> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Okay Harry. 

Second Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Okay. Gas on. 

<Direction: holding a gas pipe to her mouth> 

First Gas Man(Michael Palin): Right, deep breaths love. Ring Head Office would you Norman... 

Fourth Gas Man(Eric Idle): Shall I go through maintenance? 

Fifth Gas Man(Terry Gilliam): No, you'd better go through Deptford maintenance. 

Sixth Gas Man(None): Peckham's on a 207 .... . 

Voices(None): ... that's LeWisham. What about Tottenham? No that would be a 5.4.. what about Lewisham? It's central isn't it? Or Ruislip... 

<Direction: The camera pans along line of gas men all turning to each other and muttering incomprehensible technicalities, the line stretches across to front door. Line continues outside in street and goes into animation sequences which eventually brings us to a close-up on a small ad, which is one of many on the door of a small newsagent's shop. A shabby man is running an evil eye down the adverts, puzzling, looking for something. He walks up to the counter. He has a reflex wink.> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Good morning. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Good morning, sir. Can I help you? 

Customer(Eric Idle): Help me? Yeah, I'll say you can help me. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Yes, sir? 

Customer(Eric Idle): I come about your advert - 'Small white pussy cat for sale. Excellent condition'. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Ah. You wish to buy it? 

Customer(Eric Idle): That's right. Just for the hour. Only I aint gonna pay more'n a fiver cos it aint worth it. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Well it's come from a very good home - it's house trained. 

<Direction: long think, goes to door, looks at ads again> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Chest of drawers? Chest. Drawers. I'd like some chest of drawers please. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Yes, sir. 

Customer(Eric Idle): Does it go? 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Er, it's over there in the corner. 

<Direction: indicates a wooden chest of drawers> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Oh. 

<Direction: goes to door, runs his finger down the list of adverts> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Pram for sale. Any offers. I'd like a bit of pram please. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Ah yes, sir. That's in good condition. 

Customer(Eric Idle): Oh good, I like them in good condition, eh? Eh? 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Yes, here it is you see. 

<Direction: picks up pram looks, pauses, goes back to the door, runs finger again> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Babysitter. No, it's a babysitter. Babysitter? 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Babysitter. 

Customer(Eric Idle): Babysitter - I don't want a babysitter. Be a blood donor - that's it. I'd like to give some blood please, argh! 

<Direction: shopkeeper shakes head shopkeeper slips him a card from out of his pocket> 

Customer(Eric Idle): Blond prostitute will indulge in any sexual activity for four quid a week. What does that mean? 

<Direction: A city gent comes into shop. He has a silly walk and keeps doing little jumps and then three long paces without moving the top of his body. He buys a paper, then we follow him as he leaves the shop.> 

City Gent(John Cleese): 'Times' please. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Oh yes sir, here you are. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Thank you. 

Shopkeeper(Terry Jones): Cheers. 

<Direction: The city gent leaves the shop, from which we see a line of gas men stretching back up the road to Mrs Pinnet's house, and walks off in an indescribably silly manner. Cut to him proceeding along Whitehall, and into a building labelled 'Ministry of Silly Walks '. Inside the building he passes three other men, each walking in their own eccentric way. Cut to an office; a man is sitting waiting. The city gent enters eccentrically.> 

Minister(John Cleese): Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but I'm afraid my walk has become rather sillier recently, and so it takes me rather longer to get to work. 

<Direction: sits at desk> 

Minister(John Cleese): Now then, what was it again? 

Man(Michael Palin): Well sir, I have a silly walk and I'd like to obtain a Government grant to help me develop it. 

Minister(John Cleese): I see. May I see your silly walk? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, certainly, yes. 

<Direction: He gets up and does a few steps, lifting the bottom part of his left leg sharply at every alternate pace. He stops.> 

Minister(John Cleese): That's it, is it? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, that's it, yes. 

Minister(John Cleese): It's not particularly silly, is it? I mean, the right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half turn every alternate step. 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, but I think that with Government backing I could make it very silly. 

<Direction: rising he walks about behind the desk in a very silly fashion he sits down> 

Minister(John Cleese): Coffee? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes please. 

<Direction: pressing intercorn> 

Minister(John Cleese): Now Mrs Two-Lumps, would you bring us in two coffees please? 

Intercom Voice(None): Yes, Mr Teabag. 

Minister(John Cleese): ... Out of her mind. Now the Japanese have a man who can bend his leg back over his head and back again with every single step. While the Israelis... ah, here's the coffee. 

<Direction: Enter secretary with tray with two cups on it. She has a particularly jerky silly walk which means that by the time she reaches the minister there is no coffee left in the cups. The minister has a quick look in the cups, and smiles understandingly.> 

Minister(John Cleese): Thank you - lovely. 

<Direction: she exits still carrying tray and cups> 

Minister(John Cleese): You're really interested in silly walks, aren't you? 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh rather. Yes. 

Minister(John Cleese): Well take a look at this, then. 

<Direction: He products a projector from beneath his desk already spooled up and plugged in. He flicks a switch and it beams onto the opposite wall. The film shows a sequence of six old-fashioned silly walkers. The film is old silent-movie type, scratchy, jerky and 8mm quality. All the participants wear 1900's type costume. One has huge shoes with soles a foot thick, one is a woman, one has. very long 'Little Tich' shoes. Cut back to office. The minister hurls the projector away. Along with papers and everything else on his desk. He leans foward.> 

Minister(John Cleese): Now Mr Pudey. I'm not going to mince words with you. I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship on the Anglo-French silly walk. 

Man(Michael Palin): La Marche Futile? 

<Direction: Cut to two Frenchmen, wearing striped jerseys and berets, standing in a field with a third man who is entirely covered by a sheet.> 

First Frenchman(John Cleese): Bonjour ... et maintenant ... comme d'habitude, au sujet du Le MarchÃ© Commun. Et maintenant, je vous presente, encore une fois, mon ami, le pouf cÃ©lÃ¨bre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique. 

<Direction: he removes his moustache and sticks it onto the other Frenchman> 

Second Frenchman(Michael Palin): Merci, mon petit chou-chou Brian Trubshawe. Et maintenant avec les pieds Ã  droite, et les pieds au gauche, et maintenant l'Anglais-FranÃ§aise Marche Futile, et voilÃ  

<Direction: They unveil the third man and walk off. He is facing to camera left and appears to be dressed as a city gent; then he turns about face and we see on his right half he is dressed au style francais. He moves off into the distance in eccentric speeded-up motion.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And now a choice of viewing on BBC Television. 

<Direction: cut to BBC world symbol> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Just started on BBC2, the semi final of Episode 3 of 'Kierkegaard's Journals', staring Richard Chamberlain, Peggy Mount and Billy Bremner, and on BBC1, 'Ethel the Frog' 

<Direction: Stirring music - 'This Week' type. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'ETHEL THE FROG' Cut to Presenter at desk in usual grey suit and floral tie.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Good evening. On 'Ethel the Frog' tonight we look at violence. The violence of British Gangland. Last Tuesday a reign of terror was ended when the notorious Piranha brothers, Doug and Dinsdale 

<Direction: photo of same photo of Eastend grotty house old wedding photo> 

Presenter(John Cleese): an up-and-coming Eastend boxer. Doug was bornin February 1929 and Dinsdale two weeks later; and again a week after that. Their next door neighbour was Mrs April Simnel. 

<Direction: Exterior in street; interviewer and Mrs Simnel. Line of gas men behind.> 

Mrs Simmel(Michael Palin): Kipling Road was a typical sort of Eastend street, people were in and out of each other's houses with each other's property all day. They were a cheery lot. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Was it a terribly violent area? 

<Direction: laughs deprecatingly> 

Mrs Simmel(Michael Palin): Oh ho......yes. Cheerful and violent. I remember Doug was very keen on boxing, until he learned to walk, then he took up putting the boot in the groin. Oh he was very interested in that. His mother had such trouble getting him to come in for his tea. He'd be out there putting his little boot in, you know, bless him. You know kids were very different then. They didn't have their heads filled with all this Cartesian dualism. 

<Direction: Cut to scool playground.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): At the age of fifteen Doug and Dinsdale started attending the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell. 

<Direction: Pan to show Anthony Viney and interviewer with stick mike.> 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Anthony Viney. You taught the Piranha brothers English. What do you remember most about them? 

<Direction: He fails to point stick mike at Viney (graham) who answers. However, when the interviewer poses the next question he points the stick mike to Viney as he does so. This continues, with the mike always pointing to the one who is not talking while Viney relates a fascinating tale complete with large riveting gestures.> 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): ...Anthoney Viney. 

<Direction: Cut to presenter.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): When the Piranhas left school they were called up but were found by an Army Board to be too unstable even for National Service. Denied the opportunity to use their talents in the service of their country, they began to operate what they called 'The Operation'. They would select a victim and then threaten to beat him up if he paid the so-called protection money. Four months later they started another operation which the called 'The Other Operation'. In this racket they selected another victim and threatened 

Presenter(None): not 

Presenter(None): didn't 

Presenter(John Cleese): pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other Operation'. In this the victim was threatened that if he didn't pay them, they would beat him up. This for the Piranha brothers was the turning point. 

<Direction: Cut to Superintendent Organs SUBTITLE: 'HARRY "SNAPPER" ORGANS'> 

Organs(Terry Jones): Doug and Dinsdale Piranha now formed a gang, which the called 'The Gang' and used terror to take over night clubs, billiard halls, gaming casinos and race tracks. When they tried to take over the MCC they were for the only time in their lives, slit up a treat. As their empire spread however, we in Q Division were keeping tabs on their every move by reading the colour supplements. 

Presenter(John Cleese): A small-time operator who fell foul of Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton-Lewis. 

<Direction: Cut to Vince in a chair in a nasty flat.> 

Vince(Graham Chapman): Well one day I was sitting at home threatening the kids, and I looked out of the hole in the wall and sees this tank drive up and one of Dinsdale's boys gets out and he comes up, all nice and friendly like, and says Dinsdale wants to have a talk with me. So he chains me to the back of the tank and takes me for a scrape round to Dinsdale's. And Dinsdale's there in the conversation pit with Doug and Charles Paisley, the baby crusher, and a couple of film producers and a man they called 'Kierkegaard', who just sat there biting the heads of whippets and Dinsdale sayd 'I hear you've been a naughty boy Clement' and he splits me nostrils open and saws me leg off and pulls me liver out, and I said my name's not Clement and then he loses his temper and nails my head to the floor. 

<Direction: off-screen> 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): He nailed your head to the floor? 

Vince(Graham Chapman): At first, yeah 

Presenter(John Cleese): Another man who had his head nailed to the floor was Stig O' Tracey. 

<Direction: Cut to another younger more cheerful man on sofa.> 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Stig, I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your head to the floor. 

Stig(Eric Idle): No, no. Never, never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to give his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): But the police have film of Dinsdale actually nailing your head to the floor. 

Stig(Eric Idle): Oh yeah, well - he did that, yeah. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Why? 

Stig(Eric Idle): Well he had to, didn't he? I mean, be fair, there was nothing else he could do. I mean, I had transgressed the unwritten law. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): What had you done? 

Stig(Eric Idle): Er... Well he never told me that. But he gave me his word that it was the case, and that's good enough for me with old Dinsy. I mean, he didn't want to nail my head to the floor. I had to insist. He wanted to let me off. There's nothing Dinsdale wouldn't do for you. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): And you don't bear him any grudge? 

Stig(Eric Idle): A grudge! Old Dinsy? He was a real darling. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): I understand he also nailed your wife's head to a coffee table. Isn't that right Mrs O' Tracey? 

<Direction: Camera pans to show woman with coffee table nailed to head.> 

Mrs O' Tracey(Graham Chapman): Oh, no. No. No. 

Stig(Eric Idle): Yeah, well, he did do that. Yeah, yeah. He was a cruel man, but fair 

<Direction: Cut back to Vince.> 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Vince, after he nailed your head to the floor, did you ever see him again 

Vince(Graham Chapman): Yeah.....after that I used to go round his flat every Sunday lunchtime to apologize and we'd shake hands and then he'd nail my head to the floor 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Every Sunday? 

Vince(Graham Chapman): Yeah but he was very reasonable about it. I mean one Sunday when my parents were coming round for tea, I asked him if he'd mind very much not nailing my head to the floor that week and he agreed and just screwed my pelvis to a cake stand. 

<Direction: Cut to man affixed to a coffee table and a standard lamp.> 

Man(Terry Jones): He was the only friend I ever had. 

<Direction: Cut to block of concrete with a man upside down with his head buried in it. I wouldn't head a word against him. Cut to a gravestone, which says: 'R.I.P. and Good Luck, Dinsdale'. Lovely fella.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Clearly Dinsdale inspired tremendous loyalty and terror amongst his business associates, but what was he really like? 

<Direction: Cut to a bar.> 

Gloria(John Cleese): I walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions and found him a most charming and erudite companion. He was wont to introduce one to eminent persons, celebrated American singers, members of the aristocracy and other gang leaders. 

<Direction: off screen> 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): How had he met them? 

Gloria(John Cleese): Through his work for charity. He took a warm interest in Boys' Clubs, Sailors' Homes, Choristers' Associations, Scouting Jamborees and of course the Household Cavalry. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): Was there anything unusual about him? 

Gloria(John Cleese): I should say not. Dinsdale was a perfectly normal person in every way. Except is as much as he was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he referred to as Spiny Norman. 

Interviewer(Eric Idle): How big was Norman supposed to be? 

Gloria(John Cleese): Normally he was wont to be about twelve feet from nose to tail, but when Dinsdale was 

Gloria(None): very 

Gloria(John Cleese): depressed Norman could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was about, Dinsdale would go very quiet and his nose would swell up and his teeth would start moving about and he'd become very violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin. Dinsdale was a gentleman. And what's more he knew how to treat a female impersonator. 

<Direction: Cut to dark-suited loony in armchair. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A CRIMINOLOGIST'> 

Criminologist(Graham Chapman): It is easy for us to judge Dinsdale Piranha too harshly. After all he only did what many of us simply dream of doing... 

<Direction: tic...controls himself> 

Criminologist(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry. After all a murderer is only an extroverted suicide. Dinsdale was a looney, but he was a happy looney. Lucky bastard. 

Presenter(John Cleese): Most of the strange tales concern Dinsdale, but what about Doug? One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti. 

<Direction: Cut to tatty office with desk and phone. Vercotti at deak.> 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): Well, I had been running a successful escort agency - high class, no really, high class girls - we didn't have any of that. That was right out. And I decided. 

<Direction: phone rings on desk he answers it watch Chinese watch he replaces reciever> 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): Anyway I decided then to open a high-class night club for the gentry at Biggleswade with International cuisine, cooking, top-line acts, and not a cheap clip joint for picking up tarts, that was right out, I deny that completely, and one night Dinsdale walked in with a couple of big lads, one of whom was carrying a tactical nuclear missile. They said I'd bought one of their fruit machines and would I pay for it. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): How much did they want? 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): Three quarters of a million pounds. Then they went out. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Why didn't you call the police? 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): Well I had noticed that the lad with the thermo-nuclear device was the Chief Constable for the area. Anyway a week later they came back, said that the cheque had bounced and that I had to see Doug. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): Doug? 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): Doug 

<Direction: takes a drink> 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): I was terrified of him. Everyone was terrified of Doug. I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug. 

Interviewer(Terry Jones): What did he do? 

Vercotti(Michael Palin): He used sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire. 

<Direction: Cut to map. voice over> 

Presenter(John Cleese): By a combination of violence and sarcasm, the Piranha brothers by February 1966 controlled London and the South East. In February, though, Dinsdale made a big mistake. 

<Direction: Cut back to bar and Gloria> 

Gloria(John Cleese): Latterly Dinsdale had become increasingly worried about Spiny Norman. He had come to the conclusion that Norman slept in an aeroplane hangar at Luton Airport. 

Presenter(John Cleese): And so on February 22nd 1966, at Luton airport... 

<Direction: stock film of H-Bomb exploding> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Even the police began to sit up and take notice. 

<Direction: Cut to 'Snapper' Organs.> 

Organs(Terry Jones): The Piranhas realized they had gone too far and that the hunt was on. They went into hiding and I decided on a subtle approach, viz some form of disguise, as the old helmet and boots are a bit of a giveaway. Luckily my years with Bristol Rep. stood me in good stead, as I assumed a bewildering variety of disguises. I tracked them to Cardiff, posing as the Reverend Smiler Egret. Hearing they'd gone back to London, I assumed the identity of a pork butcher, Brian Stoats. 

<Direction: photo of Organs disguised as a butcher photo of Organs as Gloucester photo of Ratty photo> 

Organs(Terry Jones): in 'Man of la Mancha' which the 'Bristol Evening Post' described as 'a glittering performance of rare perception', although the 'Bath Chronicle' was less than enthusiastic. In fact it gave me a right panning. I quote... 

<Direction: Cut to press cutting, shich reads:> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): 'As for the performance of Superintendent Harry "Snapper" Organs as Sancho Panza, the audience were bemused by his high-pitched Welsh accent and intimidated by his abusive ad-libs.'

Organs(Terry Jones): 'The 'Western Daily News' said......

Policeman(Graham Chapman): Never mind, Snapper, love, you can't win 'em all 

Organs(Terry Jones): True constable. Could I have my eye-liner please?

Organs(Terry Jones): Good-oh. Bet it's from Binkie. 

Second Policeman(None): Those flowers are for Sergant Lauderdale - from the gentleman waiting outside 

Organs(Terry Jones): Oh good 

<Direction: Knock, knock. Head comes round the door.> 

Man(Terry Jones): Thirty seconds, superintendent. 

Organs(Terry Jones): Oh blimey, I'm on. Is me hat straight, constable? 

Policeman(Graham Chapman): Oh it's fine 

Organs(Terry Jones): Right here we go then, Hawkins. 

Policeman(Graham Chapman): Oh, merde, superintendent. 

Organs(Terry Jones): Good luck, then. 

<Direction: Cut to exterior of Police Station. They come down the stairs and walk off along pavement. The city gent passes them doing his silly walk. Cut to a little newspaper seller Read all about it. Piranha brothers escape. Cut to suburban street: it completely clears very fast. Freeze frame on empty street. An enormous hedgehog higher that the houses comes into shot saying 'Dinsdale?' Roll credits, behind which we see the enormous hedgehog appearing in various well-known London locations. Dinsdale? Dinsdale? Dinsdale? Cut to John in cage as in opening shot.>

<Direction: roars Pan to next cage to show skeleton of 'It's' Man. Fade out. A field. A man with large mechanical wings, pulleys and gears contraption, running along trying to fly. Cut to him going faster. Cut to him going even faster. Cut to him even faster and suddenly he appears to take off, jumping off a dune or a hillock. Cut to him flying in slow motion so that it looks like he is gliding. He hits what seems to be a cliff. Camera twists round so that it is the right way up, showing that the flyer has fallen down a cliff onto a beach. It pans across from the wreck of the flyer. As it pans across the sand, various other would-be fliers can be seen, heads in the sand, legs kicking up in the air, amidst the broken debris of their planes. Camera continues to pan until it comes across an announcer in DJ sitting at his desk:> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now for something completely different.

Reg(Graham Chapman): One of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treddle. 

Lady Mountback(Carol Cleveland): Well what on earth does that mean? 

Reg(None): I 

Reg(Graham Chapman): don't know. Mr Wentworth just told me to come in here and say that there was trouble at the mill, that's all - I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. 

<Direction: Jarring chord. The door flies open and Cardinal Ximinez of Spain enters, flanked by two junior cardinals. Cardinal Biggles has goggles pushed over his forehead. Cardinal Fang is just Cardinal Fang.>

Reg(Graham Chapman): I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition. 

<Direction: Jarring chord. They burst in.> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, and nice red uniforms - oh damn! 

<Direction: to Biggles> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): I can't say it, you'll have to say it. 

Biggles(Terry Jones): What? 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): You'll have to say the bit about 'Our chief weapons are ...' 

Biggles(Terry Jones): I couldn't do that...

Biggles(Terry Jones): Our chief weapons are...um...er... 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Surprise. 

Biggles(Terry Jones): Surprise and... 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Stop. Stop there! Stop there. Whew! Our chief weapon is surprise, blah, blah, blah, blah. Cardinal, read the charges. 

Fang(Terry Gilliam): You are hereby charged that you did on diverse dates commit heresy against the Holy Church. My old man said follow the...

<Direction: controls himself with a supreme effort> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): ooooh! Now, Cardinal, the rack! 

<Direction: Biggles produces a plastic-coated dish-drying rack. Ximinez looks at it and clenches his teeth in an effort not to lose control. He hums heavily to cover his anger.> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): You....Right! Tie her down. 

<Direction: Fang and Biggles make a pathetic attempt to tie her on to the drying rack> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Right! How do you plead? 

Lady Mountback(Carol Cleveland): Innocent. 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Ha! Right! Cardinal, give the rack 

<Direction: oh dear> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): give the rack a turn. 

<Direction: Cardinal Biggles stands their awkwardly and shrugs.> 

Biggles(Terry Jones): I.... 

<Direction: gritting his teeth know> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): . I know you can't. I didn't want to say anything. I just wanted to try and ignore your crass mistake. 

Biggles(Terry Jones): I... 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): It makes it all seem so stupid. 

Biggles(Terry Jones): Shall I, um...? 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Oh, go on, just pretend for God's sake. 

<Direction: Biggles turns an imaginary handle on the side of the rack. The doorbell rings. Reg detaches himself from the scene and answers it. Outside there is a dapper BBC man with a suit and a beard, slightly arty.> 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Ah, hello, you don't know me, but I'm from the BBC. We were wondering if you'd come and answer the door in a sketch over there, in that sort of direction... You wouldn't have to do anything - just open the door and that's it. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): Oh, well all right, yes. 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Jolly good. Come this way. 

<Direction: Cut to film of them coming out of the front door of the house and walking to BBC van. Conversation is heard throughout (slightly faintly). .> 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Yes, we're on film at the moment you see. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): It's a link, is it? 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Yes that's right, that sort of thing, yes, a link. It's all a bit zany - you know a bit madcap funster... frankly I don't fully understand it myself, the kids seem to like it. I much prefer Des O'Connor ... Rolf Harris ... Tom Jones, you know... 

<Direction: They get into the van. It drives off. They pass an AA sign saying 'To the Sketch'. Panning shot of them, in which we see them convening and hear...> 

Reg(Graham Chapman): You do a lot of this sort of thing, do you? 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Quite a lot yes, quite a lot. I'm mainly in comedy. I'd like to be in Programming Planning actually, but unfortunately I've got a degree. 

<Direction: They arrive outside a suburban house, where the novelty salesman, Mr Johnson, is already waiting outside the front door. BBC man points and gives Reg direction. Reg goes to the door saying: 'Excuse me' and goes in, closing the front door. The novelty man rings bell. Reg opens the door.> 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Joke, sir? Guaranteed amusing. As used by the crowned heads of Europe. Has brought tears to the eyes of Royalty. 'Denmark has never laughed so much' - 'The Stage'. Nice little novelty number - 'a naughty Humphrey' - breaks the ice at parties. Put it on the table. Press the button. It vomits. Absolutely guaranteed. With refills. 'Black soap' - leave it in the bathroom, they wash their hands, real fungus grows on the fingers. Can't get it off for hours. Guaranteed to break the ice at parties. Frighten the elderly - real snakes. Comedy hernia kit. Plastic flesh wounds - just keep your friends in stitches. Guaranteed to break the ice at parties.

Or for drinks, why not buy a 'wicked willy' with a life-size winkle - serves warm beer. Makes real cocktails. Hours of amusement. Or get the new Pooh-Pooh machine. Embarrass your guests - completely authentic sound. Or why not try a new 'naughty nightie' - put it on and it melts - just watch their faces. Guaranteed to break the ice at naughty parties. Go on, go on. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): What? 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Do the punchline. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): What punchline? 

Johnson(Eric Idle): The punchline for this bit. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): I don't know it. They didn't say anything about a punchline. 

Johnson(Eric Idle): Oh! Oh well in that case I'll be saying goodbye then, sir... Goodbye then, sir. 

<Direction: He turns and walks away. Reg looks around desperately. And then runs out of the door. He runs to BBC van as Johnson walks out of picture. Cut to cabin of BBC van with the BBC man sitting there.> 

Reg(Graham Chapman): What's the punchline? 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Punchline? I don't think there's a punchline scheduled, is there? Where are we? A week 39.4 no, it's Friday, isn't it - 39.7. Oh ... here we are. Oh! 

<Direction: laughs> 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Ha, ha, ha, very good. Ha, ha, ha, very good. What a good punchline. Pity we missed that. Still, never mind, we can always do it again. Make a series out of it. Now if you'll just sign there, I'll put this through to our contracts department and you should be hearing from them in a year or two. 

Reg(Graham Chapman): Can you give me a lift back? 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Ah - can do. But won't. We were wondering if we could possibly borrow your head for a piece of animation. 

BBC Man(John Cleese): Oh jolly good. Thanks very much. You will get expenses. 

<Direction: BBC staff set on Reg and saw his head off. ANIMATION: Reg's head starts off by being thrown into picture. Animation leads to an oak panelled, Civil Service committee room. A politician is addressing three officals.>

I told the PM's PPS that AM was NBG so tomorrow PM it is for the PM nem. con. Give us a fag or I'll go spare. Now, the fiscal deficit with regard to the monetary balance, the current financial year excluding invisible exports, but adjusted of course for seasonal variations and the incremental statistics of the fiscal and revenue arrangements for the forthcoming annual budgetary period terminating in April. 

First Official(Graham Chapman): I think he's talking about taxation. 

Politician(John Cleese): Bravo, Madge. Well done. Taxation is indeed the very nub of my gist. Gentlemen, we have to find something new to tax. 

Second Official(Eric Idle): I understood that. 

Third Official(Terry Jones): If I might put my head on the chopping block so you can kick it around a bit, sir... 

Politician(John Cleese): Yes? 

Third Official(Terry Jones): Well most things we do for pleasure nowadays are taxed, except one. 

Politician(John Cleese): What do you mean?

Judge(Graham Chapman): You say anything about that and I'll do you for treason. 

Counsel(John Cleese): M'lud if we could continue ... 

Judge Kilbraken(Terry Jones): He's got a Chinese bit there. 

Judge(Graham Chapman): No, that's contempt of court. 

Judge Kilbraken(Terry Jones): It was only a joke. 

Judge(Graham Chapman): Contempt of court. However, I'm not going to punish you, because we're so short of judges at the moment, what with all of them emigrating to South Africa. I'm going tomorrow; I've got my ticket. Get out there and get some decent sentencing done. Ooh, England makes you sick. Best I can manage here is life imprisonment. It's hardly worth coming in in the morning. Now, South Africa? You've got your cat of nine tails, you've got four death sentences a week, you've got cheap drinks, slave labour and a booming stock market. I'm off, I tell you. Yes, I'm up to here with probation and bleeding psychiatric reports. That's it, I'm off. That's it. Right. But I'm going to have one final fling before I leave, so I sentence you to be burnt at the stake. 

Judge Kilbraken(Terry Jones): Blimey! I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition. 

<Direction: Court reacts expectantly. Cut to suburban house. The three members of the Spanish Inquisition suddenly belt out of the door and down the path. Dick Barton music. Cut to them leaping onto a bus.> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Two, er, three to the Old Bailey please. 

<Direction: Credits start superimposed.> 

Biggles(Terry Jones): Look they've started the credits. 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. 

Biggles(Terry Jones): Come on hurry. Hurry! 

<Direction: We see shots of them coming through London.> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): There's the lighting credit, only five left. 

<Direction: more shots of the bus going through London; the credits reach the producer> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Hell, it's the producer - quick! 

<Direction: They leap off the bus into the Old Bailey. Cut to court room. They burst in.> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Nobody expects the Spa... 

<Direction: 'The End' appears> 

Ximinez(Michael Palin): Oh bugger! 

<Direction: Wide shot of enormous high block of flats. The camera seems to be searching. Suddenly it zooms in on one window. It is a bedroom...a busty girl is looking out the window. She stretches langourously and mouths. dubbed on very badly> 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): My, isn't it hot in here. 

<Direction: She starts to undress. She gets down to bra and panties, unhitches her bra and is about to slip it off her shoulders exposing her heavy bosoms when...the announcer rises up in front of the window on window cleaner's hoist.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now for something completely different. 

<Direction: Cut to an orchard or a woodland clearing, in which are a group of stuffed animals; a lion, a tiger, a cow, an elk, a leopard, two small ferrets and an owl on an overhanging branch. Sound of birdsong. The elk explodes. Cut back to John still in front of the window. We can just see Carol behind him in the bedroom casting her panties to one side - that is we just see her arm.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now for something more completely different... 

<Direction: Cut to 'It's' man> 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

<Direction: Animated titles.> 

None(None): Cut back to the same group of animals minus the elk. Birdsong etc. The elk's remains are smouldering. The owl explodes, Pan away from the woodland clearing to an open field in which at a distance a bishop in full mitre and robes is pacing up and down holding a script. Mr Chigger in a suit approaches the bishop and we zoom in to hear their conversation. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): 'Oh Mr Belpit your legs are so swollen' ... 

Bishop(None): swollen 

<Direction: tries a different voice> 

Bishop(Michael Palin): 'Oh Mr Belpit., .' 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Excuse me, excuse me. I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Oh I see. D'you ... d'you., . do you know about the flying lessons? 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. This is show five - I'm not in until show eight. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Oh I see. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): I'm just learning my lines, you know. 'Oh Mr Belpit, your legs...' 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Bit awkward, I'm a bit stuck. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Yes, well. Try over there. 

<Direction: Bishop points to a secretary some yards away sitting at a desk typing. She wears glasses and is very typically a secretary.> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Oh yes, thanks. Thanks a lot. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): 'Oh Mr Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so swollen'. 

<Direction: He continues rehearsing as Mr Chigger moves over to the secretary> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Excuse me, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application. 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Appointment? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Yes, yes. 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Certainly. Would you come this way, please. 

<Direction: She gets up, clutching a file and trips off in a typical efficient secretary's walk. Mr Chigger follows. Cut to a river. She goes straight in without looking to right or left, as if she does this routine as a matter of course. Mr Chigger follows. Halfway across the river they pass a couple of business executives hurrying in the opposite direction.> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Morning, Mr Jones, Mr Barnes. 

<Direction: Cut to a forest. They come past towards camera, passing a tea trolley on the way with a tea lady and a couple of men around it.> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Morning Mrs Wills. 

Mrs Wills(Michael Palin): Morning, luv. 

<Direction: Arty shot. Skyline of a short sharp hill, as in Bergman's 'Seventh Seal'. They come in frame right and up and over, passing two men and exchanging 'Good mornings'. Cut to seashore. Tripping along, they pass another executive. Take this to Marketing, would you. They disappear into a cave. We hear footsteps and a heavy door opening.> 

Secretary's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Just follow me. 

Mr Chigger's Voice(Terry Jones): Oh thank you. 

<Direction: Cut to a shopping street. Camera pans in close-up across road surface.> 

Secretary's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Oh, be careful. 

Mr Chigger's Voice(Terry Jones): Yes, nearly tripped. 

Secretary's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Be there soon. 

Mr Chigger's Voice(Terry Jones): Good. It's a long way, isn't it? 

Secretary's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Oh, get hold of that - watch it. 

Voice(None): Morning. 

Secretary's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Morning. Upstairs. Be careful, it's very steep. Almost there. 

<Direction: Camera reaches a GPO tent in middle of road. Morning.> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Morning. 

<Direction: they emerge from the tent cut to interior office, another identical secretary at the desk> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): In here, please. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Thank you. 

<Direction: he enters and first secretary trips off he approaches the second secretary> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Hello, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an appointment. 

Second Secretary(None): Well, Mr Anemone's on the phone at the moment, but I'm sure he won't mind if you go on in. Through here. 

<Direction: He goes through door. Mr Anemone is suspended by a wire about nine feet off the ground. He is on the telephone.> 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Ah, won't be a moment. Make yourself at home. 

<Direction: into phone he throws receiver at telephone but misses> 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Missed. Now Mr er... 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Chigger. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Mr Chigger. So, you want to learn to fly? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Yes. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Right, well, up on the table, arms out, fingers together, knees bent... 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): No, no, no. 

<Direction: very loudly Mr Chigger gets on the table Mr Chigger jumps and lands on the floor> 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Rotten. Rotten. You're no bloody use at all. You're an utter bloody wash-out. You make me sick, you weed! 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Now look here... 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): All right, all right. I'll give you one more chance, get on the table... 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Look, I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): A what? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane. 

<Direction: sarcasticaly imitation posh accent> 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): 'Oh, oh, no more buttered scones for me, mater. I'm off to play the grand piano'. 'Pardon me while I fly my aeroplane.' Now get on the table! 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Look. No one in the history of the world has ever been able to fly like that. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Oh, I suppose mater told you that while you were out riding. Well, if people can't fly what am I doing up here? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): You're on a wire. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Oh, a wire. I'm on a wire, am I? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Of course you're on a bloody wire. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): I am 

Mr Anemone(None): not 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): on a wire. I am flying. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): I am flying. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): I'll show you whether I'm on a wire or not. Give me the 'oop. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): What? 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Oh, I don't suppose we know what an 'oop is. I suppose pater thought they were a bit common, except on the bleedin' croquet lawn. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Oh, a 

Mr Chigger(None): hoop 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): . 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): 'Oh an 

Mr Anemone(None): hoop 

<Direction: taking hoop he waves hoop over head and feet> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Go on, right the way along. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): All right, all right, all right. 

<Direction: he moves hoop all the way along himself allowing the wire to pass through obvious gap in hoop's circumference> 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): . Now, where's the bleeding wire, then? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): That hoop's got a hole in. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Oh Eton and Madgalene. The hoop has an hole in. Of course it's got a hole in, it wouldn't be a hoop otherwise, would it, mush! 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): No, there's a gap in the middle, there. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Oh, a gahp. A gahp in one's hhhhhoop. Pardon me, but I'm off to play the grand piano. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Look, I can see you're on a wire - look, there it is. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Look, I told you, you bastard, I'm not on a wire. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): You are. There is. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): There isn't. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Is. 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Isn't! 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Is! 

Mr Anemone(Graham Chapman): Isn't!! 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Is!!! 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Anyway, this rather pointless bickering went on for some time until... 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'TWO YEARS LATER' Interior cockpit of airliner. Mr Chigger (pilot) and a second pilot sitting at controls.> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Gosh, I am glad I'm a fully qualified arline pilot. 

<Direction: Cut to BALPA spokesman sitting at a desk. He is in Captain's uniform and has a name plate in front of him on the desk saying 'BALPA Spokesman'.> 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): The British Airline Pilots Association would like to point out that it takes a chap six years to become a fully qualified airline pilot, and not two. 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'FOUR YEARS LATER THAN THE LAST CAPTION' Interior cockpit. For three seconds. Then cut back to BALPA spokesman.> 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): Thank you. I didn't want to seem a bit of an old fusspot just now you know, but it's just as easy to get these things right as they are easily found in the BALPA handbook. Oh, one other thing, in the Sherlock Holmes last week Tommy Cooper told a joke about a charter flight, omitting to point out that one must be a member of any organization that charters a plane for at least six months beforehand, before being able to take advantage of it. Did rather spoil the joke for me, I'm afraid. 

<Direction: phone ring puts phone down> 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): My wife just reminded me that on a recent 'High Chapparal' Kathy Kirby was singing glibly about 'Fly me to the Stars' when of course there are no scheduled flights of this kind, or even chartered, available to the general public at the present moment, although of course, when they are BALPA will be in the vanguard. Or the Trident. Little joke for the chaps up at BALPA House. And one other small point. Why is it that these new lurex dancing tights go baggy at the knees after only a couple of evenings' fun? Bring back the old canvas ones I say. It is incredible, isn't it, that in these days when man can walk on the moon and work out the most complicated hire purchase agreements, I still get these terrible headaches. Well . .. I seem to have wandered a bit, but still, no harm done. Jolly good luck. 

<Direction: Back in the cockpit of the airliner. The two pilots sit there. Atmospheric noise of a big airliner in flight. Suddenly there is a banging on the door at the back of the cockpit. off-screen the two pilots exchange a puzzled look, then shrug and go back to flying; suddenly another series of bangs on door they exchange another look; pause; a heavier bang on the door a crash as he attempts to force it; another crash and the door flies open; Mr Zanie enters suddenly realizing where he is> 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): Oh my God. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought this was the bally toilet. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): This is the control cabin. 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): Oh I know that. I'm a flying man, you know... oh yes... Bally stupid mistake... 

<Direction: A pause. Zanie remains standing at the back of cockpit. The pilots go on as if he is not there.> 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading? 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): 4.8... Steady. 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): If they had all those dials in the toilet... there wouldn't be room for anything else, would there. 

<Direction: another nervous laugh; not the slightest reaction from the pilots into intercom> 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Hello, Geneva this is Roger Five-O ... What is your cloud reading? Hello, Geneva... 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): I wouldn't fancy flying one of those sitting on the toilet... I mean it'd take the glamour out of being a pilot, wouldn't it, ha ha, flying around the world sitting on a toilet. 

Radio Voice(None): Geneva here. 4.9 ... Heavy... Over. 

Mr Chigger(Terry Jones): Serious? 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): No, not if it keeps at that level, no. 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): Mind you, if you did fly it from the toilet it would leave a lot more space up here, wouldn't it. 

<Direction: finally he realizes his attempt at small talk is not working he pushes lever down on the door which opens directly out of the plane he gives it a shoulder charge and flies straight out of the plane> 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): Aaaaaaaaaarrrggghhhhhh! 

<Direction: Plane noise overhead. Continue scream. Outside of a gent's lavatory, there is a big pile of straw. Pause, then Zanie drops onto the straw. He looks up at gent's sign.> 

Zanie(Graham Chapman): Bally piece of luck... 

<Direction: He brushes himself down and goes into gents. Cut back to cockpit. A hostess enters from the passenger cabin.> 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Oh hello. Everything all right at the back? 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): Yes, they're as quiet as dormice. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Dormice? 

<Direction: Door opens and a man in a neat suit enters. From beneath his jacket he produces a revolver with silencer attachment. He points it at the pilots.> 

Gunman(Michael Palin): All right, don't anybody move ... except to control the aeroplane ... you can move a little to do that. 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): Can I move? 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, yes. You can move a little bit. Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary muscular movements which no amount of self-control can prevent. And obviously any assertion of authority on my part, I've got to take that into account. 

<Direction: The ensuing conversation is perfectly calm and friendly.> 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Right. I mean one couldn't for example, stop one's insides from moving. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): No, no. Good point, good point. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): And the very fact that the plane is continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain extent. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): And we're all moving our lips, aren't we? 

Pilots(None): Yes, yes. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Absolutely. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): No, the gist of my meaning was that sudden... er... 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): Exaggerated movements ... 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Exaggerated 

Gunman(None): violent 

Gunman(Michael Palin): movements... are... are out. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Well, that's the great thing about these modern airliners. I mean, I can keep this plane flying with only the smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Oh, that's marvellous. 

<Direction: joining in the general spirit of bonhomie> 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): And I don't really need to move either ... unless I get an itch or something... 

<Direction: They all laugh.> 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Well that's wonderful ... 60% success, eh? 

<Direction: they laugh again> 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Anyway, bearing all that in mind, will you fly this plane to Luton, please? 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Well, this is a scheduled flight to Cuba. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): I know, I know, that's rather why I came in here with that point about nobody moving. 

First Pilot(Terry Jones): Within reason. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Within reason - yes. I... er ... er... you know, I want you to fly this plane to Luton ... please. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Right, well I'd better turn the plane round then. Stand by emergency systems. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Look I don't want to cause any trouble., 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): No, no, we'll manage, we'll manage. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): I mean, near Luton will do, you know. Harpenden, do you go near Harpenden? 

First Pilot(Terry Jones): It's on the flight path. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Okay, well, drop me off there. I'll get a bus to Luton. It's only twenty-five minutes. 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): You can be in Luton by lunchtime. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Oh, well that's smashing. 

First Pilot(Terry Jones): Hang on! There's no airport at Harpenden. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Oh well, look, forget it. Forget it. I'll come to Cuba, and get a flight back to Luton from there. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Well, we could lend you a parachute. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it... wouldn't dream of it... dirtying a nice, clean parachute. 

First Pilot(Terry Jones): I know - I know. There's a bale of hay outside Basingstoke. We could throw you out. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Well, if it's all right. 

All(None): Sure, yeah. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Not any trouble? 

Pilots(None): None at all. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to come barging in. 

Hostess(Carol Cleveland): Bye-bye. 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Thank you. Bye. 

Pilots(None): Bye. 

<Direction: They open the door and throw him out. as he falls> 

Gunman(Michael Palin): Thank you! 

<Direction: Cut to haystack in a field not the same bale of hay that was landed on before . Aeroplane noise overhead. The gunman suddenly falls into the haystack. He gets up, brushes himself down, hops over a fence, and reaches a road. He puts his hand out and a bus stops. It has 'Straight to Luton' written on it. He gets in. Conductor is just about to take his fare, when an evil-looking man with a gun jumps up and points gun at conductor.> 

Hijacker(John Cleese): Take this bus to Cuba. 

<Direction: Bus moving away from camera. The destination board changes to 'Straight to Cuba'. The bus does a speedy u-turn, and goes out of frame. Camera pans away revealing a rather rocky highland landscape. As camera pans across country we hear inspiring Scottish music.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): From these glens and scars, the sound of the coot and the moorhen is seldom absent. Nature sits in stern mastery over these rocks and crags. The rush of the mountain stream, the bleat of the sheep, and the broad, clear Highland skies, reflected in turn and loch ... 

<Direction: at this moment we pick up a highland gentleman in kilt and tam o'shanter clutching a knobkerry in one hand and a letter in the other> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): ... form the breathtaking backdrop against which Ewan McTeagle writes such poems as 'Lend us a quid till the end of the week'. 

<Direction: Cut to crofter's cottage. McTeagle sits at the window writing. We zoom in very slowly on him us he writes.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): But it was with more simple, homespun verses that McTeagle's unique style first flowered. 

<Direction: voice over> 

McTeagle(Terry Jones): If you could see your way to lending me sixpence. I could at least buy a newspaper. That's not much to ask anyone. 

Voice Over(John Cleese): One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young friend - Lassie O'Shen. 

<Direction: Cut to Lassie O'Shen - a young sweet innocent Scots girl - she is valiantly trying to fend off the sexual advances of the sound man. Two other members of the crew pull him out of shot.> 

Lassie(Eric Idle): Mr MeTeagle wrote me two poems, between the months of January and April 1969... 

Interviewer(None): Could you read us one? 

Lassie(Eric Idle): Och, I dinna like to... they were kinda personal... but I will. 

<Direction: she has immediately a piece of paper in her hand from which she reads> 

Lassie(Eric Idle): 'To Ma Own beloved Lassie. A poem on her 17th Birthday. Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday. I'm absolutely skint. But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back as soon as it comes. Love Ewan.' 

<Direction: There is a pause. She looks up. voice over Beautiful. Another pause. The soundman leaps on her and pulls her to the ground. Cut to abstract trendy arts poetry programme set. Intense critic sits on enormous inflatable see-through pouffe. CAPTION: 'ST JOHN LIMBO -- POETRY EXPERT' intensely> 

Limbo(John Cleese): Since then, McTeagle has developed and widened his literary scope. Three years ago he concerned himself with quite small sums - quick bits of ready cash: sixpences, shillings, but more recently he has turned his extraordinary literary perception to much larger sums - fifteen shillings, Â£4.12.6 ... even nine guineas ... But there is still nothing to match the huge sweep ... the majestic power of what is surely his greatest work: 'Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?'. 

<Direction: Pan across studio to a stark poetry-reading set. A single light falls on an Ian McKellan figure in black leotard standing gazing dramatically into space. Camera crabs across studio until it is right underneath him. He speaks the lines with great intensity.> 

Ian(Eric Idle): Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed? 

Ian(None): I'm right on my uppers. 

Ian(None): I can pay you back 

Ian(None): When this postal order comes from Australia. 

Ian(None): Honestly. 

Ian(None): Hope the bladder trouble's getting better. 

Ian(None): Love, Ewan. 

<Direction: Cut to remote Scottish landscape, craggy and windtorn and desolate. In stark chiaroscuro against the sky we see McTeagle standing beside a lonely pillar box, writing postcards. The sun setting behind him. voice over> 

Limbo(John Cleese): There seems to be no end to McTeagle's poetic invention. 'My new cheque book hasn't arrived' was followed up by the brilliantly allegorical 'What's twenty quid to the bloody Midland Bank?' and more recently his prizewinning poem to the Arts Council: 'Can you lend me one thousand quid?' 

<Direction: Cut to David Mercer figure in his study at a desk. CAPTION: 'A VERY GOOD PLAYWRIGHT'> 

David(Michael Palin): I think what McTeagle's pottery... er... poetry is doing is 

David(None): rejecting 

David(Michael Palin): all the traditional cliches of modern pottery. No longer do we have to be content with Keats's 'Seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness', Wordsworth's 'I wandered lonely as a cloud' and Milton's 'Can you lend us two bob till Tuesday'... 

<Direction: Cut to long shot of McTeagle walking through countryside. continues muttering indistinctly He walks out of shot past a glen containing several stuffed animals, one of which explodes. A highland spokesman stands up into shot. SUERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A HIGHLAND SPOKESMAN'> 

Highlander(John Cleese): As a Highlander I would like to complain about some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle. Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle, he was throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat, whereas he only had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also, in the Inverness pantomime last Christmas, the part of Puss in Boots was played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her lip, so that every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss, he got the back of his throat scraped. 

<Direction: A doctor's head appears out from under the kilt.> 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Look, would you mind going away, I'm trying to examine this man. 

<Direction: he goes back under the kilt; a slight pause; he re-emerges am> 

Doctor(Michael Palin): a doctor. Actually, I'm a gynaecologist... but this is my lunchhour. 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

Animation Voice(None): I've a nasty feeling I 

Animation Voice(None): am 

Animation Voice(None): somebody's lunchhour. 

<Direction: Animation leads to a living room. Doorbell rings. Lady opens the door, a milkman stands there.> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man. Good morning, madam, I'm a psychiatrist. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): You look like a milkman to me. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Good. 

<Direction: ticks form on his clipboard dressed> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): as a milkman... you spotted that - well done. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): Go away. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Now then, madam. I'm going to show you three numbers, and I want you to tell me if you see any similarity between them. 

<Direction: holds up a card saying '3' three times> 

Lady(Graham Chapman): They're all number three. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): No. Try again. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): They're 

Lady(None): all 

Lady(Graham Chapman): number three? 

Milkman(Eric Idle): No. They're 

Milkman(None): all 

<Direction: he ticks his board again> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Right. Now. I'm going to say a word, and I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head. How many pints do you want? 

<Direction: narrowing her eyes, suspecting a trap> 

Lady(Graham Chapman): Er, three? 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Yogurt? 

Lady(Graham Chapman): Er... no. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Cream? 

Lady(Graham Chapman): No. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Eggs? 

<Direction: does some adding up and whistling> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Right. Well, you're quite clearly suffering from a repressive libido complex, probably the product of an unhappy childhood, coupled with acute insecurity in adolescence, which has resulted in an attenuation of the libido complex. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): You 

Lady(None): are 

Lady(Graham Chapman): a bloody milkman. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Don't you shout at me, madam, don't come that tone. Now then, I must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and do some aptitude tests. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): I've got better things to do than come down to the dairy! 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Mrs Ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so, you are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment. Now I'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you, but it will give hundreds of lower-paid workers a good laugh. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): All right... but how am I going to get home? 

Milkman(Eric Idle): I'll run you there and back on my psychiatrist's float. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): All right. 

<Direction: The milkman and lady walk down her garden path. As they go out of the garden gate there's a cat on the garden wall. CAPTION and arrow: 'A CAT' The cat explodes. The milkman motions her towards the milk float with a large signboard which reads: 'Psychiatrist's Dairy Ltd'. Just as they are getting in, she points to all the files in the back in milk crates.> 

Lady(Graham Chapman): What are those? 

Milkman(Eric Idle): They're case histories. 

<Direction: drives off; the van speaker announces: 'Psychiatrists! Psychiatrists!' The doctor from the Scots sketch hails him> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Yes, sir? 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Ah, good morning. I'm afraid our regular psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning ... and I've got an ego block which is in turn making my wife over-assertive and getting us both into a state of depressive neurosis. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Oh, I see, sir. Who's your regular, sir? 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Jersey Cream Psychiatrists. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Oh yes, I know them. 

<Direction: puts down crate and gets out note pad> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Right, well, er, what's your job, then? 

Doctor(Michael Palin): I'm a doctor. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): ... Didn't I see you just now under a Scotsman? 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Yes, but I 

Doctor(None): am 

Doctor(Michael Palin): a doctor. Actually, I'm a gynaecologist but that was my lunchhour. 

<Direction: taking a card out of crate and showing it to the doctor this> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): remind you of?. 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Two pints of cream. 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Right... well I should definitely say you're suffering from a severe personality disorder, sir, sublimating itself in a lactic obsession which could get worse depending on how much money you've got. 

Doctor(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, I see. And a pot of yogurt, please. 

<Direction: Cut to a psychiatrist called Dr Cream in his office.> 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): I would like to take this opportunity of complaining about the way in which these shows are continually portraying psychiatrists who make pat diagnoses of patients' problems without first obtaining their full medical history. 

<Direction: Cut back to milkman with doctor. handing over yogurt> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Mind you, that's just a pat diagnosis made without first obtaining your full medical history. 

<Direction: Cut to man at desk.> 

Man(John Cleese): I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified. 

<Direction: Cut to Dr Cream.> 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Are you referring to me? 

<Direction: Cut back to man.> 

Man(John Cleese): Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links. 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Oh yes, I noticed that too. 

<Direction: Cut to BALPA man.> 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): These are not British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links. 

<Direction: Cut to man.> 

Man(John Cleese): Sorry. 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): They are in fact British Sugar Corporation Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint. 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Yes, that'll teach him. 

BALPA Man(Eric Idle): However, I would just like to add a complaint about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very tedious for the average viewer. 

<Direction: Cut to another man.> 

Another Man(Michael Palin): I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it. 

<Direction: the sixteen-ton weight falls on him Cut to a street with milkman and lady riding on milk float. It comes to a halt. They get out, milkman hails a milkmaid with yoke and two pails.> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Nurse! Would you take Mrs Pim to see Dr Cream, please. 

Milkmaid(Carol Cleveland): Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please. 

Lady(Graham Chapman): Oh, if I could walk that way I... 

Milkman and Milkmaid(Eric Idle): Sssssh! 

<Direction: The milkmaid leads Mrs Pim into a building, and into a psychiatrist's office. Dr Cream is in a chair.> 

Milkmaid(Carol Cleveland): Mrs Pim to see you, Dr Cream. 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Ah yes. I just want another five minutes with Audrey. Could you show Mrs Pim into the waiting room, please. 

Milkmaid(Carol Cleveland): Yes, doctor. 

<Direction: As milkmaid and Mrs Pim leave the room we see that there is a cow on the couch.> 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Right, Audrey. When did you first start thinking you were a cow? 

<Direction: Milkmaid and Mrs Pim emerge from building through a herd of cows and we then have a montage of shots of them walking through countryside as in opening sequence of flying lesson sketch at beginning of show. They pass a tea trolley woman, the bishop learning his script... Australian accent>

That strange feeling we sometimes get that we've lived through something before, that what is happening now has already happened. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of dÃ©jÃ  vu, that strange feeling we sometimes get that we've ...

Boniface(Michael Palin): Good ... good evening. Tonight on 'It's the Mind' we examine the phenomenon of dddddddddddÃ©jÃ  vvvvvvvvuu, that extraordinary feeling... quite extraordinary...

Boniface(Michael Palin): Look, something's happening to me. I - I - um, I think I'd better go and see someone. Goodnight. 

<Direction: Phone rings again. He leaps from desk and runs out of shot. He runs out of building into street and chases after passing milk float and leaps aboard.> 

Milkman(Eric Idle): Oi, haven't I seen you somewhere before? 

Boniface(Michael Palin): No, doctor, no. Something very funny's happening to me. 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'IT'S THE MIND -- A WEEKLY MAGAZINE OF THINGS PSYCHIATRIC' Cut to montage of photographs again with captions and music. Cut to Boniface at desk. Boniface screams and runs out of shot. Cut to same piece of film as just previously, when he chases float, leaps on and the milkman says: The milk float goes past in the background with the milkman and Boniface on it. We see the float go along the country lane past the clearing, past the bishop... camp> 

Bishop(Michael Palin): 'Oh, Mr Belpit, your legs are so swollen.' 

<Direction: .. and the secretary at her desk, past a sign saying 'to the zoo' where explosions are heard, and stops outside Dr Cream's building... Boniface runs into building and enters Dr Cream's office.> 

Dr Cream(Terry Jones): Ah, come in. Now what seems to be the matter? 

Boniface(Michael Palin): I have this terrible feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu. 

<Direction: Repeat same clip from Boniface entering.> 

Boniface(Michael Palin): I have this terrible feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu..

Announcer(John Cleese): 'THE BBC WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE NEXT ANNOUNCEMENT' 

<Direction: Cut to a group of Gumbys, all with rolled-up trousers and knotted handkerchiefs on their heads, attempting to shout in unison and failing miserably.> 

Gumbys(None): Hello, and welcome to the show. Without more ado, the first item is a sketch about architects, called The Architects Sketch...The Architects Sketch...The Architects Sketch... 

<Direction: ad the sketch fails to start they point up at a nearby building The camera pans to a window in the building. Cut to the office inside, where a board meeting is taking place. The Chairman is Mr Tid.> 

Mr Tid(Graham Chapman): Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions for the design of this... 

<Direction: he is distracted by the two Gumbys still shouting shouts out of window at the gumbys but the gumbys is still shouting 'Architects Sketch'; he throws a bucket of water over them; they subside, damply knock at door Mr Wiggin comes in> 

Mr Tid(Graham Chapman): Ah, yes - it's Mr Wiggin of Ironside and Malone. 

<Direction: Wiggin walks to the table on which his model stand.> 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Good morning, gentlemen. This is a twelwe-storey block combining classical neo-Georgian features with the efficiency of modern techniques. The tenants arrive in the entrance hall here, and are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes, towards the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh slurps into these... 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): Excuse me.... 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Hm? 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): Did you say knives? 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Rotating knives, yes. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Are you proposing to slaughter our tenants? 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Does that not fit in with your plans? 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): No, it does not. We asked for a simple block of flats. 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Oh, I see. I hadn't correctly divined your attitude towards your tenants. You see I mainly design slaughter houses. Yes, pity. Mind you, this is a real beaut. I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of the windows, inconveniencing the passers-by with this one. I mean, my life has been building up to this. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Yes, and well done, but we want a block of flats. 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): May I ask you to reconsider. I mean, you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade. 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): No, no, it's just that we wanted a block of flats, not an abattoir. 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Yes, well, of course, this is just the sort blinkered philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you non-creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome, spotty behinds squeezing blackheads, not caring a tinker's cuss about the struggling artist. 

<Direction: shouting> 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): You excrement! You lousy hypocritical whining toadies with your lousy colour TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding masonic handshakes! You wouldn't let me join, would you, you blackballing bastards. Well I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on your lousy, stinking, purulent knees and begged me. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Well, we're sorry you feel like that but we, er, did want a block of flats. Nice though the abattoir is. 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): Oh 

<Direction: blows raspberry> 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): the abattoir, that's not important. But if any of you could put in a word for me I'd love to be a freemason. Freemasonry opens doors. I mean, I was...I was a bit on edge just now, but if I were a mason I'd sit at the back and not get in anyone's way. 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): Thank you. 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): I've got a second-hand apron. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Thank you. 

<Direction: going to door but stopping> 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): I nearly got in at Hendon. 

<Direction: Mr Wiggin leaves and the familiar figure of Mr Tid comes forward.> 

Mr Tid(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry about that, gentlemen. The second architect is Mr Leavey of Wymis and Dibble. 

<Direction: Mr Leavey comes in and goes to his model.> 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): Good morning gentlemen. This is a scale model of the block. There are twenty-eight storeys, with two hundred and eighty modern apartments. There are three main lifts and two service lifts. Access would be from Dibbingley Road. 

<Direction: the model falls over, and he quickly puts it upright the model falls over again he puts model upright and holds onto it the model partly collapses, the bottom ten floors giving way the model is smoking and flames are seen> 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): we have almost totally removed the risk of... 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SATIRE' 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): Quite frankly, I think the central pillar system may need strengthening a bit. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Isn't that going to put the cost up? 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): It might. 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Well, I don't know whether I'd worry about strengthening 

Second City Gent(None): that 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): much. After all, they're not meant to be luxury flats. 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): I quite agree. I mean, providing the tenants are of light build and relatively sedentary and er, given a spot of good weather, I think we're on to a winner here. 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): Thank you. 

<Direction: The model explodes.> 

Second City Gent(Terry Jones): Quite agree. Quite agree. 

Mr Leavey(Eric Idle): Thank you very much. Thank you. 

<Direction: he shakes hands with them in an extraordinary way at door> 

Mr Wiggin(John Cleese): It opens doors, I'm telling you. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Let's have a look at that handshake again in slow motion. 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'BBC TV ACTION REPLAY' They do the handshake again, only slowly.> 

First Voice Over(Eric Idle): What other ways are there of recognizing a mason? 

<Direction: Shot from camera concealed in a car so we get reactions of passers-by. A busy city street - i.e. Threadneedle Street. In amongst the throng four city gents are leaping along with their trousers round their ankles. They are wearing bowler hats and pinstripes. Another city street or another part of the same street. Two city gents, with trousers rolled up to the knee, approach each other and go into the most extraordinary handshake which involves rolling on the floor etc.> 

Second Voice Over(John Cleese): Having once identified a mason immediate steps must be taken to isolate him from the general public. Having accomplished that it is now possible to cure him of these unfortunate masonic tendencies through the use of behavioural psychotherapy. 

<Direction: we see a cartoon city gent locked into a cell> 

Second Voice Over(John Cleese): In this treatment the patient is rewarded for the correct response and punished for the wrong one. Let us begin. Would you like to give up being a mason? Think carefully. Think. Think. 

Cartoon City Gent(None): No. 

<Direction: A large hammer attacks the city gent. No? That's wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! No! No! No! Bad! Bad! CAPTION: 'AN APOLOGY'> 

Announcer(John Cleese): The BBC would like to apologize for the following announcement. 

<Direction: Pull out from caption to reveal that it is not a caption after all but a huge twenty-foot-square poster on a hoarding on the side of the road. After we pull out we hear the shuffling of many feet and grunting. A group of Gumbys shuffle into extreme left edge of frame. They do not move any futher into the picture. After a bit of humming and harring:> 

Gumbys(None): Oh! And the next item is called 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'...

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'STRAIGHT MAN' 

Man(Graham Chapman): Well I've come about your special fully comprehensive motor insurance policy offer... 

Devious(Michael Palin): What was that? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Fully comprehensive motor insurance for one-and-eightpence. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Oh, oh, yes...yeah well, unfortunately, guv, that offer's no longer valid. You see, it turned out not to be commercially viable, so we now have a totally new offer... 

Man(Graham Chapman): What's that? 

Devious(Michael Palin): A nude lady. 

Man(Graham Chapman): A nude lady? 

Devious(Michael Palin): Yes. You get a nude lady with a fully comprehensive motor insurance. If you just want third party she has to keep her bra on, and if it's just theft... 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, no, I don't really want that, Mr er...Mr... 

Devious(Michael Palin): Devious. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Mr Devious. I just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully comprehensive inurance on a 1970 Aston Martin. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Aston Martin? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

<Direction: quickly> 

Devious(Michael Palin): Five hundred quid. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Five hundred quid? 

Devious(Michael Palin): Forty quid. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Forty quid? 

Devious(Michael Palin): Forty quid and a nude lady. 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, no, I'm not interested in a nude lady. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Dirty books? 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, no, look, I'm not interested in any af that.

Devious(Michael Palin): Oh, come in.

Devious(Michael Palin): Now then, vic. What's the trouble? 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Well, it's about this letter you sent me. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Excuse me, do I have any more lines? 

Devious(Michael Palin): I don't know, mush, I'll have to look in the script... 

<Direction: he gets script out of drawer> 

Devious(Michael Palin): Where are we? Show 8. Are you 'man? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Yeah. 

Devious(Michael Palin): No...no, you're finished. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Well, I'll be off then. 

<Direction: he leaves reading script> 

Devious(Michael Palin): 'The vicar sits'. 

<Direction: The vicar sits.> 

Vicar(Eric Idle): It's about this letter you sent me regarding my insurance claim. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see, it's just that we're not...as yet... 

Devious(None): totally 

Devious(Michael Palin): satisfied with the grounds of your claim. 

Vicar(Eric Idle): But it says something about filling my mouth in with cement. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Oh well, that's just insurance jargon, you know. 

Vicar(Eric Idle): But my car was hit by a lorry while standing in the garage and you refuse to pay my claim. 

<Direction: rising and crossing to a filing cabinet he open the drawer of the filing cabinet and takes out a shabby old sports jacket; he feels in the pocket and pulls out a crumbled dog-eared piece of paper then puts the coat back and shuts the filing cabinet> 

Devious(Michael Palin): ...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid. 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Oh dear. 

Devious(Michael Palin): You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim, and, well, there it is. 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Oh dear, oh dear. 

Devious(Michael Palin): Still, never mind - could be worse. How's the nude lady? 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Oh, she's fine. 

<Direction: he begins to sob> 

Devious(Michael Palin): Look...Rev...I hate to see a man cry, so shove off out the office, there's a good chap. 

<Direction: The vicar goes out sobbing. Cut to outside. Vicar collects a nude lady sitting in a supermarket shopping trolley...and wheels her disconsolately away. Cut back to inside of office. Close-up of Devious. He gets out some files and starts writing. Suddenly a bishop's crook slams down on the desk in front of Devious. He looks up - his eyes register terror. Cut to reverse angle shot from below. The bishop in full mitre and robes.>

Birds singing, a hymn being sung. Suddenly, sound of a high-powered car roaring towards the church. Screech of tires as a huge open-top American car screeches to a halt outside the church. The bishop leaps out. Behind him (as throughout the film) are his four henchmen... vicars with dark glasses. They wear clerical suits and dog collars. They leap out of their car and race up the drive towards the church. As they do so the hymn is heard to come to an end. Sound of people sitting down. Cut to interior of church. Vicar climbing up into pulpit. Cut back to exterior. The bishop and his vicars racing through the doors. Interior of church. Shot of vicar in pulpit.>

Bishop(Terry Jones): We was too late. The Reverend Grundy bit the ceiling.

Bishop(Terry Jones): Hello? ... What?... We'll be right over! 

<Direction: Still of another church exterior. Crash zoom in on door. Cut to interior. A baptism party round the font. An innocent vicar is just testing the water. Pan across to the parents - a couple of shifty crooks - and two godmothers, obviously all-in wrestlers in drag (cauliflower ears etc.). As the vicar takes the baby it starts to tick loudly.> 

Vicar(John Cleese): And it is for this reason that the Christian Church lays upon you, the godparents, the obligation of seeing this child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore, I name this child...

One pulls his rope, and the other rises off the floor, hanged by the neck. The bishop arrives, just too late. Cut to another vicar at graveside.> 

Vicar(Graham Chapman): ... dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

Sound of car screeching to a halt. We pan away from grave to reveal the bishop leaping out of the car. Sound of an almighty blast from the cannon. The bishop gets back into the car immediately and turns it round. Cut to a street. Outside a cigarette shop the four clerics lounge against a wall. The bishop walks out rolling his own. Suddenly he stops. Close-up. He looks up as he hears a faint cry. Camera swings round and up - enormous zoom to high window in huge, drab city office block, where a vicar is looking out.>

Shadows running up the stair well. The bishop arrives on the top landing. Door of office. The bishop tries the door. It won't open. One vicar goes rigid.

There are no walls, just the furnishings: settee, two armchairs, sideboard, table, standard lamp, a tiled fireplace with ornaments on it. There is also a free-standing inside door.

Mrs Potter(Graham Chapman): Oh, I'll go and have a bath. 

<Direction: She goes to the free-standing door and opens it. Beyond it we see the furnishings of a bathroom. In the bath is Alfred Lord Tennyson, fully clad. As she opens the door we hear him reciting: The splendour fans on castle walls And snowy summits old in story... She slams the door.>

But, the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay!

To the right of this wall there is a large bookshelf filled with books, and in front of it there is a drinks trolley.>

<Direction: He moves off through door. Large crashing sounds. He comes downstairs into a stretch of hall leading to an outside door. As he comes suits of armour collapse, bookcase glass smashes, a grandfather clock tips over and smashes, pictures fall off walls. All this quite quickly in sequence as he passes in horror. He gets to the main door. We see his relief. He closes the main door behind him, slamming it: it's a country-house-type entrance. Cut to stock film of country house being blown up. Cut back to man looking in horror, with dust and rubble swirling around. He is holding the remains of the door.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Sorry. 

<Direction: Pull wide. He is in a patch of rubble. The Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things members walk by in their evening dress. I think we're really out this time. Yes. Jolly good. Now where's the school hall. I think it's over there. Come on. Sorry. Jolly good. They go past the bishop in the field. singing> 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Oh, Mr Belpit. Your legs are so swollen. 

Sir William(Graham Chapman): Excuse me, is that the school hall? 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Um, I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's, I think. 

Sir William(Graham Chapman): Oh, come on. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Oh, Mr Belpit!... 

<Direction: They come to a school hall. A sign says 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, presented by the staff and pupils of the Dibley School for Boys'.> 

Sir William(Graham Chapman): Oh, here we are. 

<Direction: they go in Cut to linkman in cafeteria.> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Ah well, they seem to have linked that themselves, so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So, ah, back to the school hall. 

<Direction: A school hall with a stage. Mr Praline and Brooky enter. Praline sits at piano and plays something very badly; Brooky turns the pages for him. Music ends. Unseen schoolmaster announcer:> 

Schoolmaster(Michael Palin): 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'. 

<Direction: slight applause The curtain pans. Enter headmaster in mortar board and gown.> 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): 'Tis time the seven Smith brothers had brides. Fetch me Smith Major. 

<Direction: Enter Smith Major in short pants.> 

First Smith(Terry Jones): Sir. 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): 'Tis time you and your six brothers were married. 

First Smith(Terry Jones): Thank you, Headmaster. 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Fetch me your six brothers, that the seven brothers may be together. 

<Direction: Smith Major rings handbell. Three boys enter and stand next to him. Behold, the seven brothers.> 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Right, I'll see Watson, Wilkins, and Spratt in my study afterwards. 

<Direction: has to be prompted, then declaims badly> 

First Smith(Terry Jones): But where shall we find seven brides for seven brothers? 

Second Smith(Terry Gilliam): The Sabine School for Girls. 

Third Smith(Eric Idle): Yes, and it's the Annual Dance. 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Fetch hither the seven brides for seven brothers. 

<Direction: Enter two schoolgirls. Behold the seven brides.> 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Fetch hither the padre that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers. 

<Direction: nothing happens> 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): Fetch hither the master on duty that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers. 

<Direction: entering> 

Padre(Michael Palin): Sorry, I'm late, Headmaster - I've been wrestling with Plato. 

Headmaster(Graham Chapman): What you do in your own time, Padre, is written on the wall in the vestry. 

Padre(Michael Palin): Right, do you four boys take these two girls to be your seven brides? 

Boys(None): Yes, sir. 

Padre(Michael Palin): Right, go and do your prep. 

<Direction: The curtain comes across quickly.> 

None(None): Animation sketch links us to a butcher's shop. Harmless looking city gent enters. 

Gent(Michael Palin): Good morning, I'd care to purchase a chicken, please. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): Don't come here with that posh talk you nasty, stuck-up twit. 

Gent(Michael Palin): I beg your pardon? 

Butcher(Eric Idle): A chicken, sir. Certainly. 

Gent(Michael Palin): Thank you. And how much does that work out to per pound, my good fellow? 

Butcher(Eric Idle): Per pound, you slimy trollop, what kind of a ponce are you? 

Gent(Michael Palin): I'm sorry? 

Butcher(Eric Idle): 4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting. 

Gent(Michael Palin): I see, and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in addition, please. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): Use your own, you great poofy poonagger! 

Gent(Michael Palin): What? 

Butcher(Eric Idle): Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing. 

Gent(Michael Palin): Oh, thank you. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): 'Oh, thank you' says the great queen like a la-di-dah poofta. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): That's all right, sir, call again. 

Gent(Michael Palin): Excuse me. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): What is it now, you great pillock? 

Gent(Michael Palin): Well, I can't help noticing that you insult me and then you're polite to me alternately. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir. 

Gent(Michael Palin): That's all right. It doesn't really matter. 

Butcher(Eric Idle): Tough titty if it did, you nasty spotted prancer. 

<Direction: Cut to the Grillomat in Paignton. The announcer is just handing back a cup and saucer to a waitress.> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Sorry, I asked for tea. 

<Direction: she takes it grudgingly to camera last waitress hands him back his cup> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Now I did ask for tea. 

Waitress(Graham Chapman): But you just said coffee. 

Linkman(John Cleese): No, no, that was just my announcement, just a metaphor. 

<Direction: She shrugs and begins to move off. At the table just behind him we hear her complaining noisily in the background.> 

Linkman(John Cleese): We come...look would you mind keeping it down, please...we come as - as I said just now, to the coffee. 

Waitress(Graham Chapman): Here, he said it again! 

Linkman(John Cleese): Shut up! 

<Direction: Film of a boxer (John) in training, running along a country road. All this is shot in 'Man Alive' style: plenty of hand-held documentary work. Sound of boxer's feet on the leaves and heavy breathing.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): This is Ken Clean-Air Systems, the great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is now ready to face the giant American, Satellite Five. 

<Direction: Cut to manager being driven in Rolls. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR ENGLEBERT HUMPERDINCK - MANAGER'> 

Manager(Graham Chapman): The great thing about Ken is that he's almost totally stupid. 

<Direction: Cut back to Ken jogging, the early morning sun filtering through the trees.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Every morning, he jogs the forty-seven miles from his two-bedroomed, eight-bathroom, six-up-two-down, three-to-go-house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why. 

<Direction: Cut to Ken's wife (a young married with her head in a scarf and curlers), hanging out the washing in a council estate. CAPTION: 'MRS CLEAN-AIR SYSTEMS'> 

Mrs CAS(Eric Idle): Basically Ken is a very gentle, home-loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and banging its head on the table. 

<Direction: Cut to Ken's mother - an old lady in a wheelchair. Hand-held big close-up against the sky. CAPTION: 'MRS NELLIE AIR-VENT, MOTHER'> 

Mother(Terry Jones): Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory. 

<Direction: The wheelchair moves away and we see that it is on top of a car. Cut to exterior of a semi-detached house. Night.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Every morning at his little three-room semi near Reading, Ken gets up at three o'dock 

<Direction: light goes on> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): and goes back to bed again because it's far too early. 

<Direction: Light goes out. Close-up alarm clock at 7.05. General shot of room, Ken coming out of bathroom pulling his track-suit on.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): At seven o'clock Ken gets up, he has a quick shower, a rub-down, gets into his track-suit, and goes back to bed again. 

<Direction: shot of trainer running> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer runs the 13,000 miles from his two-room lean-to in Bangkok and gets him up. 

<Direction: General shot of room to show his trainer standing over the sleeping Ken. He holds a large mallet and a steel peg.> 

Trainer(Michael Palin): I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet. 

<Direction: Cut to the empty kitchen, shot from ground level. The camera pans across to show plate of food under an upright chair, and then pans across the room to the kitchen cupboard; Mrs Clean-Air Systems at the sink.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard. 

<Direction: Cut to gym. Manager standing beside ropes of the ring. Again a hand-held 'Man Alive' type interview, with camera noise and all.> 

Manager(Graham Chapman): Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be perfectly all right. 

<Direction: Close-up alarm clock. Hands at 8.30.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): At 8.30 the real training begins. 

<Direction: General shot of room. Ken asleep in bed The door bursts open but we don't stay to see what happens. We cut immediately to outside of the house. His trainer pushes Ken out. Trainer goes back into the house (obviously to Ken's wife). Cut to Ken jogging through town. Hand held. Ken finds his way blocked by a parked car. He stops and looks very puzzled, then instead of going round it turns and runs back the way he has come.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives at what he thinks is the gym. Sometimes it's a sweetshop, sometimes it's a private house. Today its a hospital. 

<Direction: Ken turns into the gates of a hospital. There is a slight pause, and a white-coated doctor arrives at the door and points right up the street.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Urn, straight down there. Straight down there. 

<Direction: Ken follows his finger and looks very hard in that direction. When he is satisfied that Ken has understood where he is pointing, the doctor retires back inside. Ken turns and watches him as he does this, then turns and sets off in the opposite direction. Cut to a shot of a roadside diner.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and rubs gravel into his hair. 

<Direction: Pan down to roadside to reveal Ken just finishing rubbing gravel into his hair; he stands up and hops over a railing to a riverside where a bed stands Ken hops into the bed Trainer runs into shot, pauses by bedside and turns to camera. He has large plumber's bag.> 

Trainer(Michael Palin): Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off. 

<Direction: Cut to stock close-up of punchbag and glove smashing into it. Continual hitting and impact-bang-bang-bang-bang throughout.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): What is he like in the ring, this human dynamo, this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart, Maureen Spencer. 

<Direction: Cut to medium close-up of Maureen, very busty in boxing gear and sparring helmet.> 

Maureen(Carol Cleveland): Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up, gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man - well, he should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by six. 

<Direction: She goes back to sparring and we see it is she who is hitting the punchbag. Remaining on her we hear the voice over.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula Wilcox, the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before turning pro in 1968. 

<Direction: Cut to typical teenage girl's bedside. Pin-ups of popstars on the walls. Teddy bears on the bed and gonks. Petula Wilcox is sitting up on the bed knitting.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): She's keen on knitting and likes Cliff Richard records. How does she rate her chances against Ken? 

Petula(Connie Booth): Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse him, particularly with his brain problem. 

<Direction: Cut to the ring. Floodlight. The night of the big fight. Murmur of a huge crowd. Excitement, cigar smoke rising in front of the camera. Bustle of activity all around. In medium close-up the master of ceremonies walks out into the middle of the ring, and takes the microphone.> 

Master of Ceremonies(Michael Palin): My lords, ladies and gedderbong... On my right, from the town of Reigate in the county of Kent, the heavyweight... 

<Direction: unintelligible applause, cut to Ken's corner; Ken raises his arms above his head> 

Master of Ceremonies(Michael Palin): and on my left! Miss Petula Wilcox. 

<Direction: SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: ROUND 1 For the first time we see Petula dance out into the middle of the ring, frail and lovely in a white muslin dress, with a bow in her hair and boxing gloves. The referee bring them together, cautions them and then they separate. The bell goes. As speeded-up as we can manage and with the same stupendous sound effects as for all-in cricket, Ken belts the hell out of Petula. While this goes on, we hear a few voice overs.> 

Colonel Type(John Cleese): I think boxing's a splendid sport - teaches you self-defense. 

Critic(Terry Jones): Obviously boxing must have its limits, but providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man beating the living daylights out of a little schoolgirl. 

Voice(None): It's quick and it's fun. 

<Direction: Boxing match is still in full swing as we cut away to the Grillomat snack bar. A dim light; the announcer has gone. There is only the waitress setting chairs on the tables, and cleaning. She looks up as the camera comes on her.> 

Waitress(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, he's gone. But he left a message. Jack! Where's that note that fellow left? 

Jack(Eric Idle): Oh, here you are. 

Waitress(Graham Chapman): It says sorry, had to catch the last bus. Am on the 49b to Babbacombe. 

<Direction: Cut to the top of an open-top bus driving along.> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Oh, er, there you are. Hello. You got the note, jolly good. Well, um, that's all the items that we have for you this week and er, what a jolly nice lot of items too, eh? Um...well, the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might 

<Direction: start to roll credits over this miserably they'll starting to cry> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end. 

<Direction: It says 'The End'. Quiz show set-up. Two contestants either side, compÃ¨re in the middle. On the back wall in large letters it says 'It's a Living'. Music plays brightly. Track quickly into compÃ¨re, losing contestants, as he starts his quick spiel. CAPTION: 'IT'S A LIVING'> 

CompÃ¨re(Eric Idle): Hello, good evening, and welcome to 'It's A Living'. The rules are very simple: each week we get a large fee; at the end of that week we get another large fee; if there's been no interruption at the end of the year we get a repeat fee which can be added on for tax purposes to the previous year or the following year if there's no new series. Every contestant, in addition to getting a large fee is entitled to three drinks at the BBC or if the show is over, seven drinks - unless he is an MP, in which case he can have seven drinks before the show, or a bishop only three drinks in toto. The winners will receive an additional fee, a prize which they can flog back and a special fee for a guest appearance on 'Late Night Line Up'. Well, those are the rules, that's the game, we'll be back again same time next week. Till then. Bye-bye. 

<Direction: Cut to BBC world symbol.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Well, it's five past nine and nearly time for six past nine. On BBC 2 now it'll shortly be six and a half minutes past nine. Later on this evening it'll be ten o'clock and at 10.30 we'll be joining BBC 2 in time for 10.33, and don't forget tomorrow when it'll be 9.20. Those of you who missed 8.45 on Friday will be able to see it again this Friday at a quarter to nine. Now here is a time check. It's six and a half minutes to the big green thing. 

Second Voice Over(Terry Jones): You're a loony. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): I get so bored. I get so bloody bored. 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: for a minute or two strange things happen on animation until suddenly we find ourselves into the animated title sequence. Cut to the announcer in a silly location, sitting at his desk as usual.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): You probably noticed that I didn't say 'and now for something completely different' just now. This is simply because I am unable to appear in the show this week. 

<Direction: looks closely at script, puzzled> 

Announcer(John Cleese): Sorry to interrupt you. 

<Direction: Cut to a man holding his mouth open to show the camera his teeth.> 

Man(Terry Jones): I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's hurting, just around here. 

Voice(None): Get off. 

Man(Terry Jones): Oh, sorry. 

<Direction: Cut to pompous moustached stockbroker type.> 

Nabarro(Graham Chapman): I'm not sorry to interrupt - I'll interrupt anything if it gets people looking in my direction - like at my old school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on at this very moment. 

<Direction: There is a ripple effect, and a muted trumpet plays a corny segue sequence. We mix through to the trumpeter at a school prize giving. On the stage of the school hall there is a long table behind which are sitting several distinguished people. A bishop in a grey suit and purple stock and dog collar gets up.> 

Bishop(Michael Palin): My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, it gives me very great pleasure to return to my old school, to present the prizes in this centenary year. This school takes very justifiable pride in its fine record of... aaaaagh! 

<Direction: Hands pull him down behind the table. Fighting, punching, struggle, grunts etc. No reaction at all from the distinguished guests. The bishop's head reappears for a moment.> 

Bishop(Michael Palin): ... scholarship and sporting achievement in all... aaaagh! 

<Direction: He disappears again. More noises. Up comes another bishop dressed identically.> 

Second Bishop(Eric Idle): I'm, I'm afraid there's been a mistake. The man who has been speaking to you is an impostor. He is not in fact the Bishop of East Anglia, but a man wanted by the police. 

Second Bishop(None): I 

<Direction: he puts the silver cup into a sack> 

Second Bishop(Eric Idle): Next we come to the Fairfax Atkinson Trophy for outstanding achievement in the field of Applied Mathematics. Well, there was no-one this year who reached the required standard so it goes in my sack. And by an old rule of the school all the other silver trophies also go in my sack ... aaagh! 

<Direction: He is dragged down by an unseen hand. More sounds of fighting, noisier than before even. A Chinaman in Mao jacket and cap appears.> 

Chinaman(Graham Chapman): Velly solly for hold-up ... no ploblem now ... me are Bishop of East Anglia, now piesent plizes ... Eyes down for first plize ... The Fyffe-Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics... 'goes to ... People's Republic of China! Aaaagh! 

<Direction: The Chinaman is dragged down beneath the table as were the others. Again sound of struggle, thumps etc. A plainclothes policeman stands up.> 

Detective(Terry Jones): Good evening, everybody. My name's Bradshaw - Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia, and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy to... 

<Direction: A shot. He leaps backwards. Sound of machine guns and exploding shells. Two men in army uniform with camouflage sticking out of tin helmets rush up to the table and exchange fire. They have a huge bazooka which they fire from time to time. appearing from beneath the table, shouting above the din of the battle explosion and smoke, debris over the stage explosion a wretched schoolboy appears on the stage keeping his head down he manages to get the cup but as he stands to shake hands he is shot> 

Soldier(John Cleese): Oh... bad luck! The next prize... 

<Direction: Mix through to a picture on a TV monitor and pull out from monitor to reveal a studio set as for a late-night discussion programme.> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Mr L.F. Dibley's latest film 'if'. 

<Direction: he turns to Dibley> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Mr Dibley, some people have drawn comparisons between your film, 'if', which ends with a gun battle at a public school, and Mr Lindsay Anderson's film, 'if', which ends with a gun battle at a public school. 

Dibley(Terry Jones): Oh yes, well, I mean, there were some people who said my film '2001 - A Space Odyssey', was similar to Stanley Kubrick's. I mean, that's the sort of petty critical niggling that's dogged my career. It makes me sick. I mean, as soon as I'd made 'Midnight Cowboy' with the vicar as Ratso Rizzo, John Schlesinger rushes out his version, and gets it premiered while mine's still at the chemist's. 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Well, we have with us tonight one of your films, 'Rear Window', which was to become such a success for Alfred Hitchcock a few weeks later. Now this is a silent film, so perhaps you could talk us through it... 

<Direction: Cut to a dim, shaky 8mm shot of a window. It is open. After a few seconds a man appears and looks out. He then performs over-exaggerated horror and points, looking at camera. Then he disappears and then he reappears.> 

Dibley(Terry Jones): Yes, well, let's see now ... there's the rear window. There's the man looking out of the window. He sees the murder. The murderer's come into the room to kill him, but he's outwitted him and he's all right. The End. I mean, Alfred Hitchcock, who's supposed to be so bloody wonderful, padded that out to one and a half hours ... lost all the tension ... just because he had bloody Grace Kelly he made Â£3 million more than I did. Mind you, at least she can act a bit, I could have done with her in 'Finian's Rainbow' ... The man from the off-licence was terrible ... a real failure that was - ten seconds of solid boredom. 

<Direction: Cut to shaky titles: Mr Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow starring the man from the off-licence'. Cut to the man from the off-licence standing by a tennis-court. He wears a dress and appears to be trying to say something - he has forgotten his words. He does an unconvincing little dance. CAPTION: 'THE END'> 

Dibley(Terry Jones): Bloody terrible. 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Mr L. F. Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow'. And now over to me. 

<Direction: close-up of interviewer> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Exclusively on the programme today we have the Foreign Secretary, who has just returned from the bitter fighting in the Gulf of Amman. He's going to tell us about canoeing. 

<Direction: On the bank of a river seen from the other side. There is a canoe on the bank a man in a pinstripe suit stands beside it. SUPERIMPOSEN CAPTION: 'THE FOREIGN SECRETARY' He gives a little cough and gets in. Two Arabs run in from other side of frame, lift up the canoe and throw it and the Foreign Secretary into the water. Cut back to the interviewer.> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): That gives you just some idea of what's going on out there. Today saw the long-awaited publication of the Portman Committee's Report on Industrial Reorganization... 

None(None): CAPTION: 'SOMETHING SILLY'S GOING TO HAPPEN' 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): It's taken five years to prepare and it's bound to have an enormous impact on the future of industrial relations in this country. In the studio tonight Lord Porlman, Chairman of the Committee, Sir Charles Avery, Employers' Reorganization Council, and Ray Millichope, leader of the Allied Technicians' Union. And they're going to make a human pyramid. 

<Direction: Three men in shorts run on to accompaniment of tinkly music and form a pyramid As they complete it we cut to film of Vatican crowds and dub on enormous ovation.> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Bra... vo. Now the President of the Board of Trade... 

<Direction: Cut back to the same river bank shot from across the river. The President of the Board of Trade in pinstripes is standing beside a hamper. He smiles and gets in, and lowers the lid. Once again two Arabs run in from either side and throw it in. All these sequences are speeded up.> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Now here's the Vice-Chairman of ICI. 

<Direction: Cut back to same river bank. A head looking out of the hamper. It disappears as two Arabs run in and toss it in.> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Well, so much for politics and the problems of Britain's industrial reorganization. Now we turn to the lighter subject of sport, and Reg Harris, the former world cycling sprint champion, talks to us about the psychological problems of big race preparation. 

<Direction: Reg and his bike are thrown in the river by the Arabs two hampers thrown in river by four Arabs> 

Interviewer(Graham Chapman): Well, all good things must come to an end, and that's all for this week. But to close our programme, Dame Irene Stoat, who celebrates her eighty-fifth birthday this month, reads one of her most famous poems. 

<Direction: Cut to the river bank. An old lady is standing beside it, but this time on the bank of the river nearest the camera. On the other bank we see the Arabs run into shot, realize they've been foiled and leap up and down in anger.> 

Dame Irene(Michael Palin): Who shall declare this good, that ill 

Dame Irene(None): When good and ill so intertwine 

Dame Irene(None): But to fulfil the vast design of an omniscient will. 

Dame Irene(None): When seeming again but turns to loss 

Dame Irene(None): When earthly treasure proves but dross 

Dame Irene(None): And what seems lost but turns again 

Dame Irene(None): To high eternal gain. 

<Direction: The Arabs run out of vision. Suddenly, from right beside the camera, with a bloodcurdling scream a Samurai warrior with drawn sword leaps upon her and hurls her backwards into the water. The warrior then strikes up a fierce heroic pose for the camera. SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: 'NEWHAVEN - LE HAVRE. GETAWAY TO THE CONTINENT' Cut to a smart dinner party. There are two couples in evening dress at the table. Candles burning on the polished wood, a fire burning in the grate. Muted music and sophisticated lighting.> 

Hostess(Rita Davies): We had the most marvelous holiday. It was absolutely fantastic. 

Host(Michael Palin): Absolutely wonderful. 

Hostess(None): Michael, you tell them about it. 

Host(Michael Palin): No, darling, you tell them. 

Hostess(None): You do it so much better. 

<Direction: The doorbell rings.> 

Host(Michael Palin): Excuse me a moment. 

<Direction: The host goes and answers the door of the flat, which opens straight into the dining room. Standing at the door is a large grubby man carrying a tub on his shoulder. There are flies buzzing around him. He walks straight in.> 

Man(John Cleese): Dung, sir. 

Host(Michael Palin): What? 

Man(John Cleese): We've got your dung. 

Host(Michael Palin): What dung? 

Man(John Cleese): Your dung. Three hundredweight of heavy droppings. Where do you want it? 

<Direction: he looks round for a likely place> 

Host(Michael Palin): I didn't order any dung. 

Man(John Cleese): Yes you did, sir. You ordered it through the Book of the Month Club. 

Host(Michael Palin): Book of the Month Club? 

Man(John Cleese): That's right, sir. You get 'Gone with the Wind', 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and with every third book you get dung. 

Host(Michael Palin): I didn't know that when I signed the form. 

Man(John Cleese): Well, no, no. It wasn't on the form - they found it wasn't good for business. Anyway, we've got three hundredweight of dung in the van. Where do you want it? 

Host(Michael Palin): Well, I don't think we do. We've no garden. 

Man(John Cleese): Well, it'll all fit in here - it's top-class excrement. 

Host(Michael Palin): You can't put it in here, we've having a dinner party! 

Man(John Cleese): 'Salright. I'll put it on the telly. 

<Direction: He brings it into the dining room. The guests ignore him.> 

Host(Michael Palin): Darling... there's a man here with our Book of the Month Club dung. 

Hostess(None): We've no room, dear. 

Man(John Cleese): Well, how many rooms have you got, then? 

Host(Michael Palin): Well, there's only this room, the bedroom, a spare room. 

Man(John Cleese): Oh well, I'll tell you what, move everything into the main bedroom, then you can use the spare room as a dung room. 

<Direction: The doorbell goes and there standing at the door which hasn't been closed is a gas board official with a dead Indian over his shoulders.> 

Host(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Dead Indian. 

Host(Michael Palin): What? 

Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Have you recently bought a new cooker, sir? 

Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Ah well, this is your free dead Indian, as advertised... 

Host(Michael Palin): I didn't see that in the adverts... 

Gas Man(Graham Chapman): No, it's in the very small print, you see, sir, so as not to affect the sales. 

Host(Michael Palin): We've no room. 

Man(John Cleese): That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the spare room on top of the dung. 

Dead Indian(None): Me ... heap dizzy. 

Host(Michael Palin): He's not dead! 

Gas Man(Graham Chapman): Oh well, that's probably a faulty cooker. 

<Direction: The phone rings. The wife goes to answer it.> 

Man(John Cleese): Have you, er... you read and enjoyed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman', then?

Timmy(Eric Idle): Sorry, I was on the phone to America. It's been super having this lovely little chat. We must do this again more often. Er... will you get the coffees? I'm afraid I must dash, I'm an hour late for the Israeli Embassy.

Officer(Terry Jones): Here is the result for Leicester. Arthur J. Smith... 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Sensible Party 

Officer(Terry Jones): 30,612...Jethro Q. Walrustitty... 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Silly Party 

Officer(Terry Jones): 32,108. 

<Direction: Cheering from the crowd. Cut back to studio. even more excited> 

Linkman(John Cleese): Well, there's the first result and the Silly Party has held Leicester. What do you make of that, Norman? 

<Direction: Cut to Norman. He is very excited.> 

Norman(Michael Palin): Well, this is largely as I predicted, except that the Silly Party won. I think this is largely due to the number of votes cast. Gerald? 

<Direction: Cut to Gerald standing by the 'swingometer' - a pivoted pointer on a wall chart.> 

Gerald(Eric Idle): Well there's a swing here to the Silly Party...but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you. 

<Direction: Cut to George also standing by a swingometer.> 

George(Terry Jones): Well, if I may...I think the interesting thing here is the big swing to the Silly Party and of course the very large swing back to the Sensible Party...and a tendency to wobble up and down in the middle because the screw's loose. 

<Direction: Cut to Alphonse.> 

Alphonse(Graham Chapman): No, I'm afraid I can't think of anything. 

<Direction: Cut to Eric.> 

Eric(Terry Gilliam): I can't add anything to that. Colin?

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Silly. 

Officer(Eric Idle): 12,441. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): And so the Silly Party has taken Luton. 

Linkman(John Cleese): A gain for the Silly Party at Luton. The first gain of the election, Norman? 

Norman(Michael Palin): Well this is a highly significant result. Luton, normally a very sensible constituency with a high proportion of people who aren't a bit silly, has gone completely ga-ga. 

Linkman(John Cleese): Do we have the swing at Luton? 

Gerald(Eric Idle): Well, I've worked out the swing, but it's a secret. 

Linkman(John Cleese): Er, well, ah, there...there 

Linkman(None): isn't 

Linkman(John Cleese): the swing, how about a swong? 

Norman(Michael Palin): Well, I've got the swong here in this box and it's looking fine. I can see through the breathing holes that it's eating up peanuts at the rate of knots. 

Linkman(John Cleese): And how about the swang? 

Alphonse(Graham Chapman): Well, it's 29% up over six hunded feet but it's a little bit soft around the edges about... 

Linkman(John Cleese): What do you make of the nylon dot cardigan and plastic mule rest? 

<Direction: off> 

Voice(Terry Jones): There's no such thing. 

Linkman(John Cleese): Thank you, Spike. 

Norman(Michael Palin): Can I just come in here and say that the swong has choked itself to death. 

George(Terry Jones): Well, the election's really beginning to hot up now. 

Eric(Terry Gilliam): I can't add anything to that. 

Colin(None): Can I just add at this point that this is in fact the second time I've ever been on television? 

Linkman(John Cleese): I'm sorry, Sasha, we're just about to get another result. 

<Direction: A large number of candidates in Harpenden Town Hall.> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): Hello, from Harpenden. This is a key seat because in addition to the official Silly candidate there is an independent Very Silly candidate

Linkman(John Cleese): Norman 

Norman(Michael Palin): Well, I've just heard from Luton that my auntie's ill, er, possibly, possibly gastro-enteritis - Gerald. 

Gerald(Eric Idle): Er, well, if this were repeated over the whole country it's probably be very messy. Colin. 

Colin(None): Can I just butt in and say here that it's probably the last time I shall ever appear on television. 

Linkman(John Cleese): No I'm afraid you can't, we haven't got time. Just to bring you up to date with a few results, er, that you may have missed. Engelbert Humperdinck has taken Barrow-in-Furness, that's a gain from Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. Arthur Negus has held Bristols. That's not a result, that's a bit of gossip. Er...Mary Whitehouse has just taken umbrage. Could it be a bit of trouble there. And apparently Wales is not swinging at all. No surprise there. And...Monty Python has held the credits. 

<Direction: Roll credits. Lots of activity behind from the experts. SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'NO CHANGE' Stock film of fast moving Huns thundering around on horseback.>

<Direction: Curtains open. The compÃ¨re leaves the stage. A man in city gent's outfit walks into the spotlight.> 

Minister(Terry Jones): Good evening. Tonight I'd like to restate our position on agricultural subsidies, 

<Direction: soft breathy jazzy music creeps in behind his words and he starts to strip as he talks he has now removed all his clothes apart from a tassel on each nipple and one on the front of some skin-tight briefs; he starts to revolve the tassels on his nipples he turns revealing a tassle on each buttock which he also revolves> 

Minister(Terry Jones): and for world peace. Thank you and goodnight.

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Yeah, well, I mean it's (a) not going to respond to a nice piece of cheese and (b) it isn't going to fit into a trap. 

Mrs Concrete(Michael Palin): Oh - what are you going to do? 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Well, we'll have to look for the hole. 

<Direction: We follow them as they look along the wainscotting.> 

Mrs Concrete(Michael Palin): Oh yeah. There's one here. 

<Direction: She indicates a small black mousehole.> 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): No, no, that's mice. 

<Direction: He reaches in and pulls out a line of mice strung out on a piece of elastic. Then he lets go so they shoot in again. The ratcatcher moves on. He moves a chair, behind which there is a three-foot-high black hole.> 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Ah, this is what we're after. 

<Direction: The baa-ings get louder. At this point six cricketers enter the room.> 

Cricketer(John Cleese): Excuse me, is the third test in here? 

Mr Concrete(Terry Jones): No - that was a joke - a joke! 

Cricketer(John Cleese): Oh blimey, 

<Direction: exeunt> 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscotting. 

<Direction: Cut to 'Wains Cotting' woman, who rushes out again.> 

Woman(Eric Idle): They said it again. 

<Direction: Back to the sitting room.> 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): I'm going to lay down some sheep poison. 

<Direction: He disappears into the hole. We hear: Baa, baa, baa. A gunshot. The ratcatcher reappears clutching his arm.> 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun! 

Mrs Concrete(Michael Palin): Blimey. 

Ratcatcher(Graham Chapman): Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid creature, but you've got a killer. 

<Direction: Poster: 'Wanted For Armed Robbery - Basil' with a picture of a sheep. Exciting crime-type music. Mix through to newspaper headlines: 'Farmers Ambushed in Pen', 'Merino Ram in Wages Grab'. Eerie science fiction music; mix through to a laboratory. A scientist looking through microscope and his busty attractive assistant.> 

Professor(Eric Idle): It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first-class shot. 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): But where are they coming from, professor? 

Professor(Eric Idle): That I don't know. I just don't know. I really just don't know. I'm afraid I really just don't know. I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I have to tell you I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I'm afraid I have to tell you... 

<Direction: she hands him a glass of water which she had been busy getting as soon as he started into this speech resuming normal breezy voice> 

Professor(Eric Idle): ... I don't know. Our only clue is this portion of wolf's clothing which the killer sheep ... 

<Direction: Cut to Viking.> 

Viking(Terry Gilliam): ... was wearing... 

<Direction: Cut back to sketch.> 

Professor(Eric Idle): ... in yesterday's raid on Selfridges. 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): I'll carry out tests on it straight away, professor. 

<Direction: She opens a door to another lab; but it is full of cricketers.> 

Cricketer(John Cleese): Hello, is the third test in here, please? 

<Direction: She slams the door on them.> 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): Professor, there are some cricketers in the laboratory. 

Professor(Eric Idle): This may be even more serious than even I had at first been imagining. What a strange... strange line. There's no time to waste. Get me the Chief Commissioner of Police. 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): Yes, sir! 

<Direction: She opens a cupboard and slides out the Chief Commissioner of Police on a sort of slab. He grins and waves cheerily. 'This is Your Life' music and applause.> 

Professor(Eric Idle): No, no, on the phone. 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): Oh... 

<Direction: she pushes him back in> 

Professor(Eric Idle): Look of fear! 

<Direction: he is staring transfixed at something in the doorway> 

Professor(Eric Idle): Another strange line. Look out, Miss Garter Oil! 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): Professor! What is it? What have you seen? 

Professor(Eric Idle): Look - there, in the doorway. 

<Direction: Cut to doorway: through it is animation of a huge sheep with an eye patch.> 

Assistant(Carol Cleveland): Urghhh! Arthur X! Leader of the Pennine Gang! 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: perhaps even mixed with stock film - as the fevered mind of Gilliam takes it - sheep armed to the teeth, sheep executing dangerous raids, Basil Cassidy and the Sundance Sheep, sheep with machine gun coming out of its arse etc. At the end of the animation, cut to studio. A narrator sitting in what could be a news set at a desk.> 

Narrator(Michael Palin): But soon the killer sheep began to infect other animals with its startling intelligence. Pussy cats began to arrange mortgages, cocker spaniels began to design supermarkets... 

<Direction: Cut back to the aninmation again: a parrot.> 

Parrot(None): And parrots started to announce television programmes. It's 8 o'clock and time for the News. 

Narrator(Michael Palin): Good evening. Here is the news for Parrots. No parrots were involved in an accident on the M1 today when a lorry carrying high-octane fuel was in collison with a bollard. That's a

Lucy(Carol Cleveland): 'Allo, 'allo, 'allo. 

Old Man(Terry Jones): 'Allo, 'allo, 'allo. 

Darnay(Graham Chapman): Who's a pretty boy, then? 

None(None): And more of the same. 

None(None): Cut back to the narrator. 

Narrator(Michael Palin): And while that's going on, here is the news for gibbons. No gibbons were involved in... 

<Direction: The narrator's voice fade.> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): And while that's going on, here from Westminster is a parliamentary report for Humans. 

Cyril(Eric Idle): In the debate, a spokesman accused the goverment of being silly and doing not at all good things. The member accepted this in the spirit of healthy criticism, but denied that he had ever been naughty with a choir boy. Angry shouts of 'What about the Watermelon then?' were ordered then by the speaker to be stricken from the record and put into a brown paper bag in the lavvy. Any further interruptions would be cut up and distributed amongst the poor. For the Government, a front-bench spokesman said the Agricultural Tariff 

Cyril(None): would 

Cyril(Eric Idle): have to be raised, and he fancied a bit. Futhermore, he argued, this would give a large boost to farmers, him, his friends, and Miss Moist of Knightsbridge. From the back benches there were opposition shouts of 'Postcards for sale' and a healthy cry of 'Who likes a sailor then?' from the minister without portfolio. Replying, the Shadow Minister said he could no longer deny the rumors, but he and the Dachshund were very happy. And in any case he argued Rhubarb was cheap, and what was the harm in a sauna bath? 

<Direction: Cut to original narrator. CAPTION: '7 Hours Later'>

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: a vicious rampaging bun.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Well that's all for Attila the Bun, and now - idiots! 

<Direction: A village idiot in smock and straw hat, red cheeks, straw in mouth, sitting on a wall, making funny noises and rolling his eyes.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Arthur Figgis is an idiot. A village idiot. Tonight we look at the idiot in society. 

<Direction: Cut to close-up of Figgis talking to camera. Very big close-up losing the top and bottom of his head. educated voice suddenly switches to rural accent vicar passes and gives him sixpence passing lady gives him sixpence> 

Figgis(John Cleese): Thank you, Mrs Thompson... this is the role that I and members of my family have fulfilled in this village for the past four hundred years... Good morning, Mr Jenkins, ICI have increased their half-yearly dividend, I see. 

<Direction: We see Mr Jenkins pass, he is also an idiot, identically dressed.> 

Mr Jenkins(Michael Palin): Yes, splendid. 

Figgis(John Cleese): That's Mr Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid. 

<Direction: He falls backwards off the wall. Cut to Figgins in idiot's costume coming out of a suburban home. He walks on to the lawn on which are several pieces of gym equipment. He runs head-on into horse (speeded up) and falls over, concussed.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Arthur takes idiotting seriously. He is up at six o'clock every morning working on special training equipment designed to keep him silly. And of course he takes great pride in his appearance. 

<Direction: Figgis, dressed in nice clean smock, jumps into a pond. He immediately scrambles up, pulls out a mirror and pats mud an his face critically, as if making-up.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Like the doctor, the blacksmith, the carpenter, Mr Figgis is an important figure in this village and - like them - he uses the local bank. 

<Direction: Village square. A bank. Figgis is walking towards it. People giggling and pointing. He goes into a silly routine. Figgis enters the bank. Cut to bank manager standing outside bank. CAPTION: 'M. BRANDO - BANK MANAGER'> 

Bank Manager(Graham Chapman): Yes, we have quite a number of idiots banking here. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): What kind of money is there in idioting? 

Manager(Graham Chapman): Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make anything up to ten thousand pounds a year - if he's the head of some big industrial combine. But of course, the more old-fashioned idiot still refuses to take money. 

<Direction: We see Figgis handing over a cheque to cashier; cashier pushes across a pile of moss, pebbles, bits of wood and acorns. voice over> 

Manager(Graham Chapman): He takes bits of string, wood, dead budgerigars, sparrows, anything, but it does make the cashier's job very difficult; but of course they're fools to themselves because the rate of interest over ten years on a piece of moss or a dead vole is almost negligible. 

<Direction: A clerk appears at door of bank.> 

Clerk(Terry Jones): Mr Brando. 

Manager(Graham Chapman): Yes? 

Clerk(Terry Jones): Hollywood on the phone. 

Manager(Graham Chapman): I'll take it in the office. 

<Direction: Cut to a woodland glade.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But Mr Figgis is no ordinary idiot. He is a lecturer in idiocy at the University of East Anglia. Here he is taking a class of third-year students. 

<Direction: Half a dozen loonies led by Figgis come dancing through the glade singing tunelessly. They are wearing long University scarves.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): After three years of study these apprentice idiots receive a diploma of idiocy, a handful of mud and a kick on the head.

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But some of the older idiots resent the graduate idiot. 

Old Idiot(Eric Idle): I'm a completely self-taught idiot. I mean, ooh arh, nob arhh, nob arhh .... nobody does that anymore. Anybody who did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays people want something wittier. 

<Direction: Wife empties breakfast over him. Cut to idiot falling repeatedly off a wall.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Kevin O'Nassis works largely with walls. 

<Direction: voice over> 

Kevin(John Cleese): You've got to know what you're doing. I mean, some people think I'm mad. The villagers say I'm mad, the tourists say I'm mad, well I am mad, but I'm naturally mad. I don't use any chemicals. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But what of the idiot's private life? How about his relationship with women? 

<Direction: Idiot in bed. Pull back to reveal he shares it with two very young, thin, nude girls.> 

Idiot(John Cleese): Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But the village idiot's dirty smock and wall-falling are a far cry from the modern world of the urban idiot. 

<Direction: stock film of city gents in their own clothes pouring out of trains> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): What kinds of backgrounds do these city idiots come from? 

<Direction: Vox pops film of city gents. Subtitles explain their exaggerated accents.>

Second City Idiot(Michael Palin): I can't remember but I've got it written down some where.

First Idiot(Michael Palin): Well left. 

Second Idiot(Graham Chapman): Well played. 

Third Idiot(Eric Idle): Well well. 

Fourth Idiot(John Cleese): Well bred. 

<Direction: dies> 

Fifth Idiot(Terry Jones): Ah! 

<Direction: Another very quick wide-shot of Lords. There is nothing at all happening and we can't distinguish anyone. Cut to three TV commentators in modern box, with sliding window open. They are surrounded by bottles.> 

Jim(John Cleese): Good afternoon and welcome to Lords on the second day of the first test. So far today we've had five hours batting from England and already they're nought for nought. Cowdrey is not out nought. Naughton is not in. Knott is in and is nought for not out. Naughton of Northants got a nasty knock on the nut in the nets last night but it's nothing of note. Next in is Nat Newton of Notts. Not Nutring - Nutting's at nine, er, Nutring knocked neatie nighty knock knock... 

<Direction: another commentator nudges him> 

Jim(John Cleese): ... anyway England have played extremely well for nothing, not a sausage, in reply to Iceland's first innings total of 722 for 2 declared, scored yesterday disappointingly fast in only twenty-one overs with lots of wild slogging and boundaries and all sorts of rubbishy things. But the main thing is that England have made an absolutely outstanding start so far, Peter? 

Peter(Graham Chapman): Splendid. Just listen to those thighs. And now it's the North East's turn with the Samba. Brian. 

<Direction: he has an enormous nose opens book> 

Brian(Eric Idle): I'm reminded of the story of Gubby Allen in '32. .. 

Jim(John Cleese): Oh, shut up or we'll close the bar. And now Bo Wildeburg is running up to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs up, he bowls to Cowdrey... 

<Direction: Cut to fast bowler. He bowls the ball but the batsman makes no move whatsoever. The ball passes the off stump.> 

Jim(John Cleese): ... and no shot at all. Extremely well not played there. 

Peter(Graham Chapman): Yes, beautifully not done anything about. 

Brian(Eric Idle): A superb shot of no kind whatsoever. I well remember Plum Warner leaving a very similar ball alone in 1732. 

Jim(John Cleese): Oh shut up, long nose. 

<Direction: Peter falls off his chair. And now it's Bo Wildeburg running in again to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs in. bowler bowls us before; ball goes by as before He bowls to Cowdrey - and no shot at all, a superb display of inertia there... And that's the end of the over, and drinks.> 

Peter(Graham Chapman): Gin and tonic please. 

Jim(John Cleese): No, no the players are having drinks. And now, what's happening? I think Cowdrey's being taken off. 

<Direction: Two men in white coats, a la furniture removers, so maybe they're brown coats, are carrying the batsman off. Two men pass them with a green Chesterfield sofa making for the wicket.> 

Jim(John Cleese): Yes, Cowdrey is being carried off. Well I never. Now who's in next, it should be number three, Natt Newton of Notts... get your hand off my thigh, West... no I don't think it is... I think it's er, it's the sofa ... no it's the Chesterfield! The green Chesterfield is coming in at number three to take guard now. 

Brian(Eric Idle): I well remember a similar divan being brought on at Headingley in 9 BC against the darkies. 

Jim(John Cleese): Oh, shut up, elephant snout. And now the green Chesterfield has taken guard and Iceland are putting on their spin dryer to bowl. 

<Direction: Furniture fielding. The whole pitch is laid out with bits of furniture in correct positions. Three chairs in the slips; easy chair keeping wicket; bidet at mid on; TV set at cover; bookcase at mid off; roll-top writing desk at square leg; radiator at mid wicket etc. The spin dryer moves forward and bowls a real ball with its snozzle to a table, which is at the batting end with cricket pads on. It hits the table on the pad. Appeal.> 

Jim(John Cleese): The spin dryer moves back to his mark, it runs out to the wicket, bowls to the table... a little bit short but it's coming in a bit there and it's hit him on the pad... and the table is out, leg before wicket. That is England nought for one. 

Different Voice Over(Michael Palin): And now we leave Lords and go over to Epsom for the three o'clock. 

<Direction: Cut to a race course. Furniture comes into shot racing the last fifty yards to the finishing post.> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): Well here at Epsom we take up the running with fifty yards of this mile and a half race to go and it's the wash basin in the lead from WC Pedestal. Tucked in nicely there is the sofa going very well with Joanna Southcott's box making a good run from hat stand on the rails, and the standard lamp is failing fast but it's wash basin definitely taking up the running now being strongly pressed by ... At the post it's the wash basin from WC then sofa, hat stand, standard lamp and lastly Joanna Southcott's box.

Kastner(Terry Jones): No, er I... 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Extraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley, who's just returned from the excavations in El Ara, and you must be well over six foot. Isn't that right, Sir Robert?

Interviewer(Michael Palin): In fact, I think you're six foot five aren't you? 

<Direction: Applause from off. Sir Robert looks up in amazement.> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Oh, that's marvelous. I mean you're a totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in your seat, erect, firm. 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Yes. I thought we were here to discuss archaeology. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, of course we are, yes, absolutely, you're absolutely right! That's positive thinking for you.

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Well, they were rather small, seafaring... 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Short men, were they... eh? All squat and bent up? 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Well, I really don't know about that... 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Who were the tall people? 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): I'm afraid I don't know. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Who's that very tall tribe in Africa? 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Well, this is hardly archaeology. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi! Oh, that's the tribe, some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders, oh no - eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall. 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Yes, but it's nothing to do with archaeology. 

<Direction: knocking Sir Robert's vase to the floor> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Oh to hell with archaeology! 

Kastner(Terry Jones): Can I please speak! I came all the way from Oslo to do this program! I'm a professor of archaeology. I'm an expert in ancient civilizations. All right, I'm only five foot ten. All right my posture is bad, all right I slump in my chair. But I've had more women than either of you two! I've had half bloody Norway, that's what I've had! So you can keep your Robert Eversley!

<Direction: he breaks into song again (singing) Today I hear the robin sing Today the thrush is on the wing Danielle joins in Today who knows what life will bring. They are just about to embrace, when there is a jarring chord and long crash. The interviewer, in the clothes he wore before, is standing on the edge of the dig.> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): All right Eversley, get up out of that trench. 

Sir Robert(John Cleese): Don't forget... I'm six foot five.

<Direction: Cut to studio. A vicar sitting facing camera. He has an axe in his head.> 

Reverend Belling(Graham Chapman): You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no fault of their own, are sane. Some of them were born sane. Some of them became sane later in their lives. It is up to people like you and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these people overcome their sanity. You can start in small ways with ping-pong ball eyes and a funny voice and then you can paint half of your body red and the other half green and then you can jump up and down in a bowl of treacle going 'squawk, squawk, squawk...' And then you can go 'Neurhhh! Neurhh!' and then you can roll around on the floor going 'pting pting pting' ... 

<Direction: he rolls around on the floor> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): The Reverend Arthur Belling is Vicar of St Loony Up The Cream Bun and Jam. And now an appeal on behalf of the National Trust.

Man(Eric Idle): Good morning. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): Good morning. 

Man(Eric Idle): Are you the registrar? 

Registrar(Terry Jones): I have that function. 

Man(Eric Idle): I was here on Saturday, getting married to a blond girl, and I'd like to change please. I'd like to have this one instead please. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): What do you mean? 

Man(Eric Idle): Er, well, the other one wasn't any good, so I'd like to swap it for this one, please. Er, I have paid. I paid on Saturday. Here's the ticket. 

<Direction: gives him the marriage licence.> 

Registrar(Terry Jones): Ah, oh, no. That was when you were married. 

Man(Eric Idle): Er, yes. That was when I was married to the wrong one. I didn't like the colour. This is the one I want to have, so if you could just change the forms round I can take this one back with me now. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): I can't do that. 

Man(Eric Idle): Look, make it simpler, I'll pay again. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): No, you can't 

Registrar(None): do 

Registrar(Terry Jones): that. 

Man(Eric Idle): Look, all I want you to do is change the wife, say the words, blah, blab, blah, back to my place, no questions asked. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): I'm sorry sir, but we're not allowed to change. 

Man(Eric Idle): You can at Harrods. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): You can't. 

Man(Eric Idle): You can. I changed my record player and there wasn't a grumble. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): It's different. 

Man(Eric Idle): And I changed my pet snake, and I changed my Robin Day tie. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): Well, you can't change a bloody wife! 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh, all right! Well, can I borrow one for the weekend. 

Registrar(Terry Jones): No! 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh, blimey, I only wanted a jolly good...

Host(Graham Chapman): Ah, John. Allow me to introduce my next-door neighbour. John Stokes, this is A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. Ah! 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Hello, I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross your face for a moment just then, but you needn't worry - I'm used to it. That's the trouble of having a surname like Git. 

John(Michael Palin): Oh ... yes, yes. 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): We did think once of having it changed by deed-poll, you know - to Watson or something like that. But A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Watson's just as bad eh? 

John(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, I suppose so. 

<Direction: Mrs Git approaches.> 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Oh, that's my wife. Darling! Come and meet Mr... what was it?

Mrs Stokes(Carol Cleveland): What? 

John(Michael Palin): The Gits.

Mr Git(Terry Jones): I was just telling your husband what an awful bore it is having a surname like Git. 

<Direction: understanding at last> 

Mrs Stokes(Carol Cleveland): OH Oh well, it's not that bad. 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Oh, you've no idea how the kids get taunted. Why, only last week Dirty Lying Little Two-Faced came running home from school, sobbing his eyes out, and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty Horrible Vicious Little is just at the age when taunts like 'she's a git' really hurt. Yes. 

<Direction: Mrs Git gobs colourfully into her handbag.> 

John(Michael Palin): Do ... do you live round here? 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Yes, we live up the road, number 49 - you can't miss it. We've just had the outside painted with warm pus. 

<Direction: with increasing embarrassment> 

John(Michael Palin): Oh. 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Yes. It's very nice actually. It goes nicely with the vomit and catarrh we've got smeared all over the front door. 

Mrs Stokes(Carol Cleveland): I think we ought to be going. We have two children to collect. 

Mr Git(Terry Jones): Oh, well, bring them round for tea tomorrow.

Nun(Carol Cleveland): I preferred the dirty version. 

<Direction: She is knocked out by the boxer. Cut to Women's Institute applause film.> 

None(None): Big close-up Hank Spim (face only). He is obviously walking along, the camera is following him hand held. 

Hank(Graham Chapman): Well, I've been a hunter all my life. I love animals. That's why I like to kill 'em. I wouldn't kill an animal I didn't like. Goodday Roy. 

<Direction: Pull back to reveal he is walking with his brother in fairly rough country location. They pull a small trailer with 'high explosives' written in large letters on the side. The trailer has bombs in it. Hank takes a bazooka from the trailer.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Hank and Roy Spim are tough, fearless backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent, unrelenting world of nature's creatures, where only the fittest survive. Today they are off to hunt mosquitoes. 

<Direction: Big close-up Roy Spim. He is obviously searching for something. voice over> 

Roy(Eric Idle): The mosquito's a clever little bastard. You can track him for days and days until you really get to know him like a friend. He knows you're there, and you know he's there. It's a game of wits. You hate him, then you respect him, then you kill him. 

<Direction: Cut to Hank Spim who stands peering toward the horizon. Suddenly he points.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're after. 

<Direction: Dramatic music. Crash zoom along Hank's eyeline to as big a close-up as we can get of a patch in a perfectly ordinary field. Cut back to Hank and Roy starting to crawl towards some bushes.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Now more than ever, they must rely on the skills they have learnt from a lifetime's hunting. 

<Direction: tense music, as they worm their way forward shot of Hank doing complicated wind gauging biz. shot of Roy examining the ground intently Roy fires a bazooka. Hank fires off a machine gun; a series of almighty explosions in the small patch of field; the gunfire stops and the smoke begins to clear Hank and Roy approach the scorched and blackened patch in the field Roy points machine gun at head of mosquito and fires off another few rounds> 

Roy(Eric Idle): There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded mosquito. 

Voice Over(John Cleese): But the hunt is not over. With well practised skill Hank skins the mosquito. 

<Direction: Hank produces an enormous curved knife and begins to start skinning the tiny mosquito shot of them walking, carrying weapons inside villa; Hank is cleaning bazooka> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Here, surrounded by their trophies Roy and Hank prepare for a much tougher ordeal - a moth hunt. 

Hank(Graham Chapman): Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter to lure it away from the flowers, and then Roy comes along in the Lockheed Starfighter and attacks it with air-to-air missiles. 

Roy(Eric Idle): A lot of people have asked us why we don't use fly spray. Well, where's the sport in that? 

<Direction: Shot of them driving in Land Rover heavily loaded with weapons.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): For Roy, sport is everything. Ever since he lost his left arm battling with an ant, Roy has risked his life in the pursuit of tiny creatures. 

<Direction: a peaceful river bank; Roy and Hank are fishing Hank presses a button and there is a tremendous explosion in the water> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Wherever there is a challenge, Hank and Roy Spim will be there ready to carry on this primordial struggle between man and inoffensive, tiny insects. 

<Direction: Pull out to reveal the brothers standing on a tank. Heroic music reaches a climax. Apropos of nothing cut to oak-panelled robing chamber in the Old Bailey. Two Judges in full wigs and red robes enter. very camp> 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Oh, I've had such a morning in the High Court. I could stamp my little feet the way those QC's carry on. 

<Direction: just as camp> 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Don't I know it, love. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Objection here, objection there! And that nice policeman giving his evidence so well - beautiful speaking voice ... well after a bit all I could do was bang my little gavel. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): You what, love? 

First Judge(Eric Idle): I banged me gavel. I did me 'silence in court' bit. Ooh! If looks could kill that prosecuting counsel would be in for thirty years. How did your summing up go? 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Well, I was quite pleased actually. I was trying to do my butch voice, you know, 'what the jury must understand', and they loved it, you know. I could see that foreman eyeing me. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Really? 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Yes, cheeky devil. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Was he that tall man with that very big... ? 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): No, just a minute - I must finish you know. Anyway, I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes', and I waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly, but it was a stunning effect. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Oh, I bet it was... like that super time I wore that striped robe in the Magistrates Court. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Oh, aye. 

<Direction: Fade out. Fade into a bench in a public park, garden or square. A pepperpot is sitting on the bench. Another pepperpot comes by pushing a shopping trolley.> 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Hello, Mrs Thing. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Hello, Mrs Entity. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): How are you then?

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Busy?

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): You must be exhausted. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Mm. Oh, have you been shopping? 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): No, I've been shopping. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Funny. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): I'm worn out. I've been shopping for six hours. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): What have you bought, then? 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Nothing. Nothing at all. A complete waste of time. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Wicked, isn't it? 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Wicked. It'll be worse when we join the Common Market. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): That nice Mr Heath would never allow that. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): It's funny he never married. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): He's a bachelor. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Oooh! That would explain it, Oh dear me, this chatting away wears me out. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Yes. I bet Mrs Reginald Maudling doesn't have to put up with all this drudgery, getting up at five in the morning, making a cup of tea, looking out of the window, chatting away. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): No! It'd all be done for her. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Yes, she'd have the whole day free for playing snooker. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): She probably wouldn't go through all the drudgery of playing snooker, day in, day out. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): No, it would all be done for her. She wouldn't even have to lift the cue. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): She probably doesn't even know where the billlard room is. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): No, still, it's not as bad as the old days. Mrs Stanley Baldwin used to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out and catch partridges with her bare hands. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Yes... and Mrs William Pitt the Elder used to have to get up at three o'clock and go burrowing for truffles with the bridge of her nose. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Mrs Beethoven used to have to get up at midnight to spur on the mynah bird. 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Lazy creatures, mynah birds,.. 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Yes. When Beethoven went deaf the mynah bird just used to mime. 

<Direction: The picture begins to wobble as in flashback; appropriate dreamy music effect. looking at camera> 

First Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Ooh! What's happening? 

Second Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): It's all right. It's only a flashback.

Beethoven(John Cleese): Shut up! 

Mynah(None): Right in the wing. 

Beethoven(John Cleese): Shut your beak. Gott in Himmel... I never get any peace here. 

<Direction: He plays the first few notes of the fifth symphony, trying vainly to get the last note. Mrs Beethoven enters.> 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Ludwig! 

Beethoven(John Cleese): What? 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Have you seen the sugar bowl? 

Beethoven(John Cleese): No, I haven't seen the bloody sugar bowl.

Beethoven(John Cleese): Stuff the jam spoon! 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): It was in the sugar bowl. 

Beethoven(John Cleese): Look, get out you old rat-bag. Buzz off and shut up. 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): I don't know what you see in that piano. 

<Direction: she goes> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): Leave me alone!! ... 

<Direction: gets the first eight notes right at last> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): ... Ha! ha! ha! I've done it, I've done it! 

<Direction: Mrs Beethoven comes in again.> 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Do you want peanut butter or sandwich spread for your tea? 

Beethoven(John Cleese): What!!!! 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): PEANUT BUTTER... 

Beethoven(John Cleese): I've forgotten it. 

<Direction: plays a few wrong notes> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): I had it! I had it! 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Do you want peanut butter or sandwich spread? 

Beethoven(John Cleese): I don't care!! 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Ooooh! I don't know. 

<Direction: she goes out> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): I 

Beethoven(None): had 

<Direction: at the same moment as he gets it right again, the door flies open and Mrs Beethoven charges in with a very load vacuum a terrible clanking and banging comes from the wall> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): What's that! What's that! 

<Direction: still vacuuming loudly> 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): It's the plumber! 

<Direction: A jarring ring of the doorbell adds to the din.> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): Gott in Himmel, I'm going out. 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Well, if you're going out don't forget we've got the Mendelssohns coming for tea so don't forget to order some pikelets. 

Beethoven(John Cleese): Pikelets, pikelets. Shakespeare never had this trouble. 

<Direction: Shakespeare washing up at a sink present day.> 

Shakespeare(Eric Idle): You wanna bet? Incidentally, its da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum. 

<Direction: Cut back to Beethoven.> 

Beethoven(John Cleese): You're right. Oh, incidentally, why not call him Hamlet?

Shakespeare(Eric Idle): Hamlet I like much better than David.

Michelangelo(Terry Jones): Oh, my life. 

<Direction: Cut to Mozart. He is scrubbing the floor. CAPTION: 'W. A. MOZART' Jewish accent> 

Mozart(Michael Palin): Composer? Huh! I wouldn't wish it on my son. He's a sensitive boy, already. I'd rather he was a sewage attendant or a ratcatcher. 

<Direction: Cut to street with old-fashioned shops. Exterior. Camera tracks in to a shopfront with a large sign outside: 'Rodent Exterminating Boutique - Colin "Chopper" Mozart (Son Of Composer) Ratcatcher To The Nobility And Ordinary People, Too - Ici On Parle Portugaise'. At the door of shop stands Colin Mozart. A kid runs up to him bearing a long cleft stick, Mozart takes the note from the cleavage and reads it.> 

Colin Mozart(Michael Palin): Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse. Hey Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street.

Colin Mozart(Michael Palin): Colin Mozart. 

Mrs Beethoven(Graham Chapman): Oh, thank goodness you've come. We're having a terrible time with them bleeding rats. I think they live in his stupid piano already. 

<Direction: They go into the house. We hear the first two bars of Beethoven's Fifth counterpointed by loud squeaking.> 

Beethoven's Voice(John Cleese): Get out the bloody piano you stupid furry bucktoothed gits! Get out! Gott in Himmel. Get your stinking tail out of my face. 

<Direction: Mrs Beethoven opens the door and we see for the first time a strange sight. Rats are flying across the room (thrown from out of vision) others scuttle across floor (pulled by strings) others up wall. One sits on Beethoven's head. The squealing is deafening. Beethoven plays on relentlessly. Mozart and Mrs Beethoven run into room and start trying to catch the rats with the shrimp-nets. CAPTION: '13.4 MINUTES LATER' Colin Mozart is sitting on the piano. He rakes the rat-infested room with machine-gunfire.>

First Judge(Eric Idle): Well, I was ever so glad they abolished hanging, you know, because that black cap just didn't suit me. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Yes. Do you remember the Glasgow treason trial? 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Oh yes, I wore a body stocking all through it. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): No, hen, with the party afterwards. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Oh, that's right. You were walking out with that very butch Clerk of the Court. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): That's right. Ooh, he made me want to turn Queen's evidence.

First Judge(Eric Idle): What was the verdict? 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): They preferred the brown wig. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Mm. I love the Scottish Assizes. I know what they mean by a really well-hung jury. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Ooh! Get back in the witness box, you're too sharp to live! 

First Judge(Eric Idle): I'll smack your little botty! 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Ooh! and again. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Have you tried that new body rub JP's use? 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): I had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): Funnily enough I felt like one in a lunchtime recess today. 

<Direction: credits end> 

First Judge(Eric Idle): But the ones I really like are those voice over announcers on the BBC after the programs are over. 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): Oh, aye, of course, they're as bent as safety pins. 

First Judge(Eric Idle): I know, but they've got beautiful speaking voices, haven't they? 'And now a choice of viewing on BBC Television.' 

Second Judge(Michael Palin): 'Here are tonight's football results.' 

First and Second Judges(None): Mmm. 

<Direction: Fade out. The camera tracks past five gorgeous lovelies in bikini, all in send-up provocative pin-up poses. The sixth in the pan is the announcer at his desk also posing in a bikini (with bikini top).>

Third Bruce(Michael Palin): Blimey, s'hot in here, Bruce. 

First Bruce(Eric Idle): S'hot enough to boil a monkey's bum! 

Second Bruce(Graham Chapman): That's a strange expression, Bruce. 

First Bruce(Eric Idle): Well Bruce, I heard the Prime Minister use it. S'hot enough to boil a monkey's bum in 'ere, your Majesty,' he said and she smiled quietly to herself. 

Third Bruce(Michael Palin): She's a good Sheila, Bruce and not at all stuck up. 

Second Bruce(Graham Chapman): Ah, here comes the Bossfella now! - how are you, Bruce?

Third Bruce(Michael Palin): Mind if we call you 'Bruce' to keep it clear? 

Fourth Bruce(John Cleese): Well, Gentlemen, I think we'd better start the meeting. Before we start, though, I'll ask the padre for a prayer.

Rule four - I don't want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out. Rule five - no pooftahs. Rule six - there is 

Fourth Bruce(None): no 

Fourth Bruce(John Cleese): rule six! Rule seven - no pooftahs. That concludes the reading of the rules, Bruce.

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for the last few years has been contradicting people...Mr Polevaulter, why do you contradict people? 

Polevaulter(Terry Jones): I don't!

Polevaulter(Terry Jones): I most certainly did not! 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Oh. I see. I'll start again. 

Polevaulter(Terry Jones): No you won't!

Polevaulter(Terry Jones): Yes I do! 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): And when

Polevaulter(Terry Jones): No! 

<Direction: Cut to announcer at desk in farmyard. He is fondly holding a small pig.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And so on and so on and so on. And now... 

<Direction: Cut to picture of the Pope. Slight pause, so we think it might be something to do with the Pope. An arrow suddenly comes in above him pointing down at his head.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Number seventeen. The top of the head. 

<Direction: Cut to picture of an indeterminate bit of flesh with a feather sticking out. Superimposed arrow pointing to feather.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Number eighteen...the feather, rare.

Although the camera does not reveal this for a moment, this name plate, about two inches high, continues all along the desk, off the side of it at the same height and halfway round the room. We start to track along this name plate on which is written: 'Professor Sir Adrian Furrows F.R.S. F.R.C.S. F.R.C.P. M.D.M.S. (Oxon), Mall Ph.D., M. Se. (Cantab), Ph.D. (Syd), ER.G.S., F.R.C.O.G., F.

<Direction: The door opens and Raymond Luxury Yacht enters. He cannot walk straight to the desk as his passage is barred by the strip of wood carrying the degrees, but he discovers the special hinged part of it that opens like a door. Mr Luxury Yacht has his enormous polystyrene nose. It is a foot long.> 

Specialist(John Cleese): Ah! Mr Luxury Yacht. Do sit down, please. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Ah, no, no. My name is 

Mr Luxury Yacht(None): spelt 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): 'Luxury Yacht' but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Well, do sit down then Mr Throatwobbler Mangrove. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Thank you. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Now, what seems to be the trouble? 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Um, I'd like you to perform some plastic surgery on me. 

Specialist(John Cleese): I see. And which particular feature of your anatomy is causing you distress? 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Well, well for a long time now, in fact, even when I was a child ... I ... you know, whenever I left home to ... catch a bus, or... to catch a train... and even my tennis has suffered actually... 

Specialist(John Cleese): Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried about your enormous hooter. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): No! 

Specialist(John Cleese): No? 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Yes, and you want me to hack a bit off. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Please. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Fine. It is a startler, isn't it? Er, do you mind if I... er. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): What? 

Specialist(John Cleese): Oh, no nothing, then, well, I'll just examine your nose. 

<Direction: he does so; as he examines it the nose comes off in his hand> 

Specialist(John Cleese): Mr Luxury Yacht, this nose of yours is false. It's made of polystyrene and your own hooter's a beaut. No pruning necessary. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): I'd still like the operation. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Well, you've had the operation, you strange person. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): Please do an operation. 

Specialist(John Cleese): Well, all right, all right, but only ... if you come on a camping holiday with me. 

Mr Luxury Yacht(Graham Chapman): He asked me! He asked me! 

<Direction: Cut to lyrical film of Luxury Yacht and specialist, frolicking in countryside in slow motion. Cut to interviewer (the one with the hook) at desk.> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Next week we'll be showing you how to pick up an architect, how to pull a prime minister, and how to have fun with a wholesale poulterer. But now the men of the Derbyshire Light Infantry entertain us with a precision display of bad temper.

Whoops, don't look now girls the major's just minced in with that dolly colour sergeant, two, three, ooh-ho!> 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): And finally...

A man with porter's cap comes in, carrying two bags. He is followed by Mr and Mrs Irrelevant. He puts their cases down, hangs around and gets a tip. He goes behind the counter, takes off his porter's hat, puts on an airline-pilot-type cap, and puts on a moustache. There is a vicar standing next to him with an eye patch. 

Man(Eric Idle): Morning sir, can I help you? 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Er, yes, we've booked on your flight for America. 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh, we don't fly to America ... 

<Direction: vicar nudges him> 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh, the American flight... Er, on the plane ... oh yes, oh we do that, all right. Safe as houses, no need for panic. 

Mrs Irrelevant(Carol Cleveland): Is it really 37/6d? 

Man(Eric Idle): Thirty bob. I'm robbing myself. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Thirty bob! 

Man(Eric Idle): Twenty-five. Two quid the pair of yer. Er, that's without insurance. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Well, how much is it with insurance? 

Man(Eric Idle): Hundred and two quid. That's including the flight. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Do we really need insurance? 

Man(Eric Idle): No. 

Man(Eric Idle): Yes, essential. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Well, we'll have it with insurance please. 

Man(Eric Idle): Right - do you want it with the body and one relative flown back, or you can have both bodies flown back and no relatives, or four relatives, no bodies, and the ashes sent by parcel post. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): How long will it take? 

Man(Eric Idle): Er, let me put it this way - no idea. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Six hours. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): Six? 

Man(Eric Idle): Five, ten for the pair of you. 

Mrs Irrelevant(Carol Cleveland): Oh, is it a jet? 

Man(Eric Idle): Well, no ... It's not so much of a jet, it's more your, er, Triumph Herald engine with wings. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): When are you taking off?. 

Man(Eric Idle): 3300 hours. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): What? 

Man(Eric Idle): 2600 hours for the pair of you. 

Mrs Irrelevant(Carol Cleveland): What? 

Man(Eric Idle): Have the injections, you won't care. 

Mr Irrelevant(Graham Chapman): What injections? 

Man(Eric Idle): Barley sugar injections. Calm you down. They're compulsory - Board of Trade. Promise. 

<Direction: he holds up his crossed fingers> 

Mrs Irrelevant(Carol Cleveland): Oh, I don't like the sound of injections. 

<Direction: making a ringing sound picks up phone puts phone down> 

Man(Eric Idle): You've got to make your mind up straight away if you're coming or not. 

Mr and Mrs Irrelevant(None): Yes. 

Man(Eric Idle): Right, you can't change your mind. I'll ring the departure lounge. 

Man(Eric Idle): Hello? Two more on their way, Mrs Turpin. 

<Direction: Cut to Mrs Turpin sitting in a suburban lounge. A big sign saying 'Intercontinental Arrivals', in airport writing, hangs from the ceiling. Mr and Mrs Irrelevant arrive and sit down.>

<Direction: Man and vicar enter carrying a large wing.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Nearly ready. 

<Direction: They take the wing through. Hammering is heard. speaking into cup> 

Mrs Turpin(Terry Jones): All passengers please get ready for their barley sugar injections. 

<Direction: Japanese pilot comes in. Today we all take vow. Today we smash the enemy fleet... we smash, smash. Man and vicar grab him and take him back.> 

Mrs Turpin(Terry Jones): That's Mr Kamikaze, the pilot, he's very nice really, but make sure he stays clear of battleships. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of battleships, steaming on the seas. Stirring music plays over.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): There have been many stirring tales told of the sea and also some fairly uninteresting ones only marginally connected with it, like this one. Sorry, this isn't a very good announcement. Sorry. 

<Direction: Cut from sea to announcer by his desk at the seaside.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And here is the result of the 'Where to put Edward Heath's statue Competition. The winner was a Mr Ivy North who wins ten guineas and a visit to the Sailors Quarters. 

<Direction: Cut to quick clip of the Battle of Pearl Harbor from show eleven, first series. Beginning with Eric blowing the whistle and the two sides rushing at each other. Cut back to announcer.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): That was last year's re-enactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor performed by the Batley Townswomen's Guild. It was written, directed and produced by Mrs Rita Fairbanks. 

<Direction: Cut to Rita Fairbanks on the beach.> 

Rita(Eric Idle): Hello again. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): And what are your ladies going to do for us this year? 

Rita(Eric Idle): Well, this year we decided to re-enact something with a more modern flavour. We had considered a version of Michael Stewart's speech on Nigeria and there were several votes on the Committee for a staging of Herr Willi Brandt's visit to East Germany, but we've settled instead for a dramatization of the first heart transplant. Incidentally my sister Madge will be playing the plucky little springbok pioneer Christian Barnard. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Well off we go, then with the Barley Townswomen's Guild re-enactment of the first heart transplant. 

<Direction: Rita Fairbanks blows her whistle. The two groups of ladies rush at each other. They end up in the sea, rolling about splashing, and thumping each other with handbags. his desk now surrounded by sea> 

Announcer(John Cleese): The first heart transplant. But this is not the only open-air production here that has used the sea. Theatrical managers in this area have not been slow to appreciate the sea's tremendous dramatic value. And somewhere, out in this bay, is the first underwater production of 'Measure for Measure'. 

<Direction: Expanse of sea water. Dubbed over this is muffled, watery Shakespearian blank verse. We zoom in. Two Shakespearian actors (Terry J and Michael) leap up. They take a deep breath and go under again. The dialogue carries on muted. Pull out to see a rowboat. Shakespearian characters are sitting there waiting for their cue. One of the two characters leaps up and shouts:> 

Character(Terry Jones): Servant ho! 

<Direction: He then goes underwater again. The servant in the boat steps into the water and goes under. Cut to announcer, now up to his waist in sea.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): The underwater version of 'Measure for Measure', and further out to sea 'Hello Dolly' is also doing good business. 

<Direction: We see a buoy, on the top of which is a stiff piece of card which reads 'Hello Dolly, Tonight 7.30'. There is a muffled watery snatch of Hello Dolly. Swing round to a patch of open sea.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): ... and over there on the oyster beds Formula 2 car racing. 

<Direction: underwater noises of Formula 2 cars> 

None(None): ANIMATION:

And now we present the first episode of a new radio drama series, 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots.' Part One: The Beginning. 

<Direction: Theme music. 'Coronation Scot' as used in 'Paul Temple' for years. You are Mary, Queen of Scots? I am! There now follows a series of noises indicating that Mary is getting the shit knocked out of her. Thumps, bangs, slaps, pneumatic drilling, sawing, flogging, shooting, all interlaced with Mary's screams. The two women listen calmly. After a few seconds: fade as the signature tune 'Coronation Scot' is brought up loudly to denote ending of episode.> 

Radio Announcer(John Cleese): Episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', can be heard on Radio 4 almost immediately. 

<Direction: One of the women goes over to the set and switches it over. As she goes back to her seat from the radio we hear the theme music again, fading out as the sounds of violence and screaming start again and continue unabated in vigour. I think she's dead. No I'm not! After a time, sounds of violence and screaming start again rapidly fading under the tune of 'Coronation Scot'.> 

Announcer's Voice(John Cleese): That was episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', adapted for radio by Bernard Hollowood and Brian London. And now, Radio Four will explode. 

<Direction: the radio explodes> 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): We'll have to watch the telly then. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Yes 

<Direction: The pepperpots swivel round to look at the TV set in the corner of the room.> 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): What's that on the tellevision then? 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Looks like a penguin. 

<Direction: On the TV set there is indeed a penguin. It sits contendedly looking at them in a stuffed sort of way. There is nothing on the screen.> 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): No, no, no, I didn't mean what's on the television set, I meant what programme. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Oh. 

<Direction: The second pepperpot goes to the TV, switches it on and returns to her chair. The set takes a long time to warm up and produce a picture. During this pause the following conversation takes place:> 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): It's funny that penguin being there innit? What's it doing there? 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Standing. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): I can see that! 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): If it lays an egg, it will fall down the back of the television set. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): We'll have to watch that. Unless it's a male. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Ooh, I never thought of that. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Yes, looks fairly butch. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Per'aps it's from next door. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Penguins don't come from next door, they come from the Antarctic. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Burma. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Why did say Burma? 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): I panicked. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): Oh. Perhaps it's from the zoo. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Which zoo? 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): How should I know which zoo? I'm not Doctor bloody Bernowski. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): How does Doctor Bernowski know which zoo it came from? 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): He knows everything. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Oooh, I wouldn't like that, that'd take all the mystery out of life. Anyway, if it came from the zoo, it would have 'property of the zoo' stamped on it. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): No it wouldn't. They don't stamp animals 'property of the zoo'. You can't stamp a huge lion. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): They stamp them when they're small. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): What happens when they moult? 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Lions don't moult. 

Second Pepperpot(John Cleese): No, but penguins do. There, I've run rings around you logically. 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): Oh, intercourse the penguin. 

<Direction: On the TV screen there now appears an announcer.> 

TV Announcer(Terry Jones): It's just gone 8 o'clock and time for the penguin on top of your television set to explode. 

<Direction: The penguin on top of the set now explodes.> 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): How did he know that was going to happen?! 

TV Announcer(Terry Jones): It was an inspired guess. And now...

Voice Over(John Cleese): Number twenty-nine. The interior of a country house. 

<Direction: Cut to room, with doctor, mother, and son.> 

Doctor(John Cleese): That's not a part of the body. 

Mother(Carol Cleveland): No, it's a link though. 

Son(Graham Chapman): I didn't think it was very good. 

Doctor(John Cleese): No, it's the end of the series, they must be running out of ideas. 

<Direction: Inspector Muffin the Mule bursts through the door.> 

Muffin(Michael Palin): All right, don't anybody move, there's been a murder. 

Mother(Carol Cleveland): A murder? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): No... no ... not a murder... no what's like a murder but begins with B? 

Son(Graham Chapman): Birmingham. 

Muffin(Michael Palin): No ... no ... no ... no ... no... 

Doctor(John Cleese): Burnley? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Burnley - that's right! Burnley in Lancashire. There's been a Burnley. 

Son(Graham Chapman): Burglary. 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Burglary. Yes, good man. Burglary - that's it, of course. There's been a burglary. 

Doctor(John Cleese): Where? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): In the back, just below the rib. 

Doctor(John Cleese): No - that's murder. 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Oh... er no... in the band... In the bat... Barclays bat. 

Son(Graham Chapman): Barclays Bank? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Yes. Nasty business - got away with Â£23,000. 

Son(Graham Chapman): Any clues? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Any what? 

Son(Graham Chapman): Any evidence as to who did it? 

<Direction: sarcastically> 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Any clues, eh? Oh, we don't half talk posh, don't we? I suppose you say 'ehnvelope' and 'larngerie' and 'sarndwiches on the settee'! Well this is a murder investigation, young man, and murder is a very serious business. 

Doctor(John Cleese): I thought you said it was a burglary. 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Burglary is almost as serious a business as murder. Some burglaries are more serious than murder. A burglary in which someone gets stabbled is murder! So don't come these petty distinctions with me. You're as bad as a judge. Right, now! The first thing to do in the event of a breach of the peace of any kind, is to... go... 

<Direction: pause> 

Muffin(Michael Palin): and ... oh, sorry, sorry, I was miles away. 

Doctor(John Cleese): Ring the police? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Ring the police. Yes, that's a good idea. Get them over here fast ... no, on second thoughts, get them over here slowly, so they don't drop anything. 

Mother(Carol Cleveland): Shall I make us all a cup of tea? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Make what you like, Boskovitch - it won't help you in court. 

Mother(Carol Cleveland): I 

Mother(None): beg 

Mother(Carol Cleveland): your pardon? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): I'm sorry, sorry. That's the trouble with being on two cases at once. I keep thinking I've got Boskovitch cornered and in fact I'm investigating a Burnley. 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Burglary! Yes - good man. 

<Direction: Sound of police siren and sound of cars drawing up outside.> 

Doctor(John Cleese): Who's Boskovitch? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Hah! Boskovitch is a Russian scientist who is passing information to the Russians. 

Son(Graham Chapman): Classified information? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Oh, there he goes again! 'Classified information'! Oh, sitting on the 'settee' with our 'scones' and our 'classified information'! 

<Direction: The door opens and a plainclothes detective plus ten PCs (the Fred Tomlinson Singers) enter.> 

Muffin(Michael Palin): Ah! Hello, Duckie. 

Duckie(Terry Jones): Hello, sir. How are you? 

Muffin(Michael Palin): I'm fine thanks. How are you? 

Duckie(Terry Jones): Well, sir, I'm a little bit moody today, sir.

Phil(Eric Idle): Brian Distel and Brianette Zatapathique there in an improvised scene from Jean Kenneth Longueur's new movie 'Le Fromage Grand'. Brian and Brianette symbolize the breakdown in communication in our modern society in this exciting new film and Longueur is saying to us, his audience, 'go on, protest, do something about it, assault the manager, demand your money back'. Later on in the film, in a brilliantly conceived montage, Longueur mercilessly exposes the violence underlying our society when Brian and Brianerte again meet on yet another rubbish dump.

As tatters and pieces of cos lettuce float through the air in slow motion, the camera pans down to some autumn leaves. Freeze frame. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'FIN' Cut back to Phil.> 

Phil(Eric Idle): Pretty strong meat there from Longueur who is saying, of course, that ultimately materialism, in this case the Webb's Wonder lettuce, must destroy us all. That was for O. Simon, K. Simon, P. Simon and R. Sparrow of Leicester. Later on, we're going to take a look at John Wayne's latest movie, 'Buckets of Blood Pouring Out of People's Heads' but now we look ahead. On Tuesday Chris Conger took a BBC film unit to the location where 20th Century Vole are shooting their latest epic 'Scott of the Antarctic'. 

<Direction: Chris Conger standing with back to pier and a few holidaymakers behind him.> 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Sea, sand and sunshine make Paignton the queen of the English Riviera. But for the next six months this sleepy Devonshire resort will be transformed into the blizzard-swept wastes of the South Pole. For today shooting starts on the epic 'Scott of the Antarctic', produced by Gerry Schlick. 

<Direction: walks over to Schlick American> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Hello. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Gerry, you chose Paignton as the location for Scott. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Right, right. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Isn't it a bit of a drawback that there's no snow here? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Well, we have 28,000 cubic feet of Wintrex, which is a new white foam rubber which actually on screen looks more like snow than snow... 

<Direction: Cut to shot of people nailing and sticking white foam rubber over things. It looks terrible. Others are painting the sand with white paint.> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): ... and 1,600 cubic US furlongs of white paint, with a special snow finish. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): And I believe Kirk Vilb is playing the title role. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): That is correct. We were very thrilled and honoured when Kirk agreed to play the part of Lieutenant Scott 

<Direction: cut to Kirk Vilb who is wearing fur open at the chest; he is having a chest wig stuck on and icing sugar squeezed on to his nose and eyebrows cut back to Gerry Schlick and Chris Conger> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): And directing we have a very fine young British director, James McRettin, who's been collaborating on the screenplay, of course Jimmy... 

<Direction: McRettin rushes into foreground. He is in no way like J. McGrath.> 

McRettin(John Cleese): Oh, there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello. Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean, it's really saying something, don't you think? 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Have you started shooting yet? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Yes, yes. Great. Perfect. No, no, we haven't started yet. No. But great - great. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): What is the first scene that you shoot this morning? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This film is basically pro-humanity and anti-bad things and it rips aside the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony, have a drink, have a drink. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): But which 

Conger(None): scene 

Conger(Graham Chapman): are we shooting first, Jimmy? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Yes, great. Oh, marvellous. 

<Direction: calls out to Conger calls.> 

McRettin(John Cleese): I thought we cut that? Didn't we cut that? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): No, we didn't. 

McRettin(John Cleese): We didn't. Oh great. That's even better. I'll put it back in. Rewrite. 

<Direction: calling> 

McRettin(John Cleese): This is the scene - outside the tent - it's all bloody marvelous. It makes you want to throw up. 

<Direction: Cut to Schlick and Conger on the beach.> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Now in this scene Lieutenant Scott returns to camp in the early morning after walking the huskies to have brunch with the rest of his team. 

<Direction: cut to shot of tent with Bowers, who is black, and Oates, sitting outside> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Oates, played by your very own lovely Terence Lemming, who is an English cockney officer seconded to the US Navy, and Bowers played by Seymour Fortescue, the Olympic pole vaulter. 

<Direction: Film: Scott comes up to them. He has two large boxes strapped to his feet to make him look tall.> 

Oates(Terry Jones): Hi, Lieutenant. 

Scott(Michael Palin): Hi, Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already. 

<Direction: rushing in> 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great, great. 

Scott(Michael Palin): What? What are you saying? 

McRettin(John Cleese): I was just saying great, great. Cue Evans. 

<Direction: Sexy girl with long blond hair comes into shot with short pink fur coat. She walks up to Scott who towers four feet above her as she is walking in a trench.> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): And this is Vanilla Hoare as Miss Evans. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Miss Evans? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Right. 

<Direction: Miss Evans is now beneath Scott at knee height.> 

Scott(Michael Palin): Good morning, Miss Evans. 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): Oh, I've forgotten my line. 

McRettin(John Cleese): What's her line? What's her line? 

<Direction: Girl runs in with script. It's 'Good morning, Captain Scott'.> 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): Oh, yeah. 'Good morning, Captain Sc'..; oh, I'm just not really very happy with that line. Could I just say 'Hi Scottie'? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue. 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): Hi Scarrie! Oh, sorry. Hi Stocky! Oh - I'm sorry again. Oh, Jim. I'm just unhappy with this line. Hey, can I do it all sort of kooky, like this? 

<Direction: goes beserk waving hands> 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): Hi Scottie! 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great! We'll shoot it. 

Scott(Michael Palin): Are you sure that's right? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Oh, it's great. 

<Direction: Gerry Schlick walks into the shot.> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Jim. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Jim! Jim! Oh, me! 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Jim, I feel we may be running into some problems here in the area of height. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great! Where are they? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Where are who? 

McRettin(John Cleese): I don't know. I was getting confused. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Jim, I feel here, that Scott may be too tall in the area of height with reference to Vanilla who is too near the ground in the area of being too short at this time. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great ... Oh, I know. I'm going to dig a pit for Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench. 

Scott(Michael Palin): Say, why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get up out of the trench? 

McRettin(John Cleese): It wouldn't work... It's even better! Great. Rewrite! 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): What was that? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Oh, it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench. 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): I say my lines out of the trench? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Even better. Great. 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): But I've never acted out of a trench. I might fall over. It's dangerous. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Oh well, could you just try it? 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): Look, you crumb bum, I'm a star. Star, star, star. I don't get a million dollars to act out of a trench. I played Miss St John the Baptist in a trench, 

<Direction: she walks along in the trench and we see that she has two boxes strapped to her feet walks off> 

Evans(Carol Cleveland): I played Miss Galileo in a groove and I played Mrs Jesus Christ in a geological syncline, so don't... 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's all in the can. Good morning's work. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): But you haven't done a shot. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Just keeping morale up. 

<Direction: tries to take a drink from his view finder The same afternoon.> 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Now this afternoon we're going to shoot the scene where Scott gets off the boat on to the ice floe and he sees the lion and he fights it and kills it and the blood goes pssssssssshhh in slow motion. 

Conger(Graham Chapman): But there aren't any lions in the Antarctic. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): What? 

Conger(Graham Chapman): There aren't any lions in the Antarctic. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): You're right. There are no lions in the Antarctic. That's ridiculous! Whoever heard of a lion in the Antarctic? Right. Lose the lion. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Got to keep the lion. It's great! 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Lose the lion. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the lion everyone. That's fantastic. 

Scott(Michael Palin): What's this about our losing the lion? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Well, Kirk, we thought perhaps we might lose the fight with the lion a little bit, Kirk, angel. 

<Direction: loudly> 

Scott(Michael Palin): Why? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Well, Kirkie, doll, there are no lions in the Antarctic, baby. 

<Direction: shouts> 

Scott(Michael Palin): I get to fight the lion. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): It'd be silly. 

Scott(Michael Palin): Listen, I gotta fight the lion. That's what that guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): But why couldn't you fight a penguin? 

McRettin(John Cleese): Great! 

<Direction: falls over> 

Scott(Michael Palin): Fight a rotten penguin? 

Schlick(Eric Idle): It needn't be a little penguin. It can be the biggest penguin you've ever seen. An electric penguin, twenty feet high, with long green tentacles that sting people, and you can stab it in the wings and the blood can go spurting psssssshhhh in slow motion. 

Scott(Michael Palin): The lion is in the contract. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): He fights the lion. 

McRettin(John Cleese): Even better. Great. Have a drink. Lose the penguin. Stand by to shoot. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): Where do they have lions? 

Conger(Graham Chapman): Africa. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): That's it. Scott's in Africa. As many lions as we need. 

Schlick(Eric Idle): He's looking for a pole no one else knows about. That ties in with the sand. Right. Paint the sand yellow again. Okay, let's get this show on the road. 'Scott of the Sahara.' 

<Direction: Cut instantly to sky.> 

None(None): CAPTION: 'SCOTT OF THE SAHARA' 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Booming out of the pages of history comes a story of three men and one woman whose courage shocked a generation. 

<Direction: Blinding sun. Pan down to Paignton beach. Scott, Evans, Oates and Bowers wearing furs crossing sand on snow shoes. With sledge pulled by motley selection of mongrel dogs, badly disguised as huskies.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): From the same team that brought you ... 

<Direction: the names come out superimposed> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): 'Lawrence of Glareorgan' ... 'Bridge Over the River Trent' ... 'The Mad Woman of Biggleswade' ... and 'Krakatoa, East of Leamington' ... comes the story of three people and a woman united by fate who set out in search of the fabled Pole of the Sahara and found ... themselves. See ... Lieutenant Scott's death struggle with a crazed desert lion. 

<Direction: The four are walking along. Suddenly they stop, stare, and react in horror. Scott steps to the front to defend the others. Intercut, non-matching stock shot of lion running out of jungle and leaping at camera. Scott waits poised and is then struck by completely rigid stuffed lion. Montage of shots of him wrestling, firstly with the stuffed lion, then with an actor in a tatty lion suit. The lion picks up a chair, fends Scott off, smashes it over his head. Finally Scott kicks the lion on the shin. The lion leaps around on one leg and picks up a knife. Scott points, the lion looks, Scott kicks the knife out of the lion's paw. He advances on the lion, and socks him on the jaw. The lion collapses in slow motion. After a pause, phoney blood spurts out.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): See Ensign Oates' frank adult death struggle with the spine-chilling giant electric penguin... 

<Direction: Oates looks up in horror, a shadow crosses him. Reverse shot of model penguin (quite small, about a foot) which lights up and looks electric. The penguin is close to the camera in the foreground and appears huge. Oates looks around desperately then starts to undress. Shot of penguin throwing tentacle. Half-nude Oates struggles with it. Intercut a lot of phoney reverses. Oates by now clad only in posing briefs sees a stone. He picks up the stone, then camera zooms into above-naval shot; he removes his briefs, puts the stone in the briefs, twirls it like a sling, and releases stone. The penguin is hit on beak, and falls over backwards.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): ... See Miss Evans pursued by the man-eating roll-top writing desk. 

<Direction: Miss Evans is running along screaming. Shot of desk chasing her (phoney desk with man inside). The roll top goes up and down, emitting roars, and displaying fearsome white teeth inside. As Evans runs, her clothing gets torn on each of the three cactuses. These are well spaced apart so that there is a lot of trouble to get near them. When she is practically nude, she runs out of shot revealing the announcer.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now for something completely different. 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: dancing teeth. Then animation of a letter being resealed and posted - all backwards - ending in a real post office. A post office worker removes the stamp from the letter and hands it to man. Five pence please. The man walks out backwards, pasing Mr Praline as he enters. He looks at the man, puzzled, and then goes up to first of two grils which has a sign saying 'stamps and licences'.> 

Praline(John Cleese): Excuse me, I would like to buy a fish license, please. 

<Direction: the man behind the counter points to next grille; to camera he goes to next grille> 

Praline(John Cleese): Hello, I would like to buy a fish licence, please. 

Man(Michael Palin): A what? 

Praline(John Cleese): A license for my pet fish, Eric. 

Man(Michael Palin): How did you know my name was Eric? 

Praline(John Cleese): No no no, my 

Praline(None): fish's 

Praline(John Cleese): name is Eric, Eric the fish. 'E's an 'alibut. 

Praline(John Cleese): He is an halibut. 

Man(Michael Palin): You've got a pet halibut? 

Praline(John Cleese): Yes. I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like the others, they were all too flat. 

Man(Michael Palin): You must be a loony. 

Praline(John Cleese): I am not a looney! Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell that Sir Gerald Nabardo has a pet prawn called Simon and you wouldn't call him a looney; furthermore, Dawn Pailthorpe, the lady show-jumper, had a clam, called Stafford, after the late Chancellor, Allan Bullock has two pikes, both called Chris, and Marcel Proust had an haddock! So, if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche du temps perdu' a looney, I shall have to ask you to step outside! 

Man(Michael Palin): All right, all right, all right. You want a licence. 

Praline(John Cleese): Yes. 

Man(Michael Palin): For a fish. 

Man(Michael Palin): You 

Man(None): are 

Man(Michael Palin): a loony. 

Praline(John Cleese): Look, it's a bleeding pet, isn't it? I've got a license for me pet dog Eric, and I've got a license for me pet cat Eric... 

Man(Michael Palin): You don't need a license for a cat. 

Praline(John Cleese): I bleeding well do and I got one. Ho, ho, you're not catching me out there. 

Man(Michael Palin): There's no such thing as a bloody cat license. 

Praline(John Cleese): Yes there is! 

Man(Michael Palin): No there isn't! 

Praline(John Cleese): Is! 

Man(Michael Palin): Isn't! 

Praline(John Cleese): What's that then? 

Man(Michael Palin): This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed out and the word 'cat' written in in crayon. 

Praline(John Cleese): The man didn't have the proper form. 

Man(Michael Palin): What man? 

Praline(John Cleese): The man from the cat detector van. 

Man(Michael Palin): Loony detector van, you mean. 

Praline(John Cleese): It's people like you what cause unrest. 

Man(Michael Palin): All right, what cat detector van? 

Praline(John Cleese): The cat detector van from the Ministry of Housinge. 

Man(Michael Palin): Housinge? 

Praline(John Cleese): It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very observant!. I never seen so many bleeding aerials. The man said that their equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards...and Eric, being such a happy cat, was a piece of cake. 

Man(Michael Palin): How much did you pay for this? 

Praline(John Cleese): Sixty quid, and eight guineas for the fruit bat. 

Man(Michael Palin): What fruit bat? 

Praline(John Cleese): Eric the fruit-bat. 

Man(Michael Palin): Are all your pets called Eric? 

Praline(John Cleese): There's nothing so odd about that: Kemal Ataturk had an entire menagerie, all called Abdul! 

Man(Michael Palin): No he didn't! 

<Direction: takes book from pocket> 

Praline(John Cleese): He did, he did, he did, he did and did. There you are. 'Kemal Ataturk, the Man' by E. W. Swanton with a foreword by Paul Anka, page 91, please. 

<Direction: referring to page 91> 

Man(Michael Palin): I owe you an apology, sir. 

Praline(John Cleese): Spoken like a gentleman, sir. Now, are you going to give me a fish license? 

Man(Michael Palin): I promise you that there is no such thing. You don't need one. 

Praline(John Cleese): Then I would like a statement to that effect signed by the Lord Mayor. 

<Direction: Fanfare of trumpets. Mayor gorgeously dressed with dignitaries enters flanked by trumpeters.> 

Man(Michael Palin): You're in luck. 

<Direction: In long shot now. The Mayor, who is nine foot high, and dignitaries approach a startled Praline. Organ music below a reverent voice over:> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): And now, there is the Mayor. Surely the third tallest mayor in Derby's history. And there are the Aldermen magnificently resplendent in their Aldermanic hose and just look at the power in those thighs. The New Zealanders are going to find it pretty tough going in the set pieces in the second half... So Dawn Palethorpe with one clear round on Sir Gerald... and now the Mayor has reached the Great Customer Mr Eric Praline. 

<Direction: the mayor takes a piece of Paper from the post office man the mayor signs it and hands it to Praline Praline looks very confused> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): has finally gone spare and there is the going sparal look on the front of his head. And now the Aldermen are finishing their oranges and leaving the post office for the start of the second half. 

<Direction: They all exit out of door, eating oranges, and Praline looks after them. Cut to a rugby field. Crowd roaring as the aldermen, mayor, mayoress, town clerk, Dawn Palethorpe (on a horse) and the borough surveyor run onto the pitch and take up their positions.> 

Commentator(John Cleese): And here come the Derby Council XV following the All Blacks out on to the pitch. There, in the centre of the picture you can see Dawn Palethorpe on Sir Gerald - one of the fastest wingers we must have seen in England this season. On the left hand side of the picture the Lord Mayor has been running such wonderful possession for Derby Council in the lines out and it's the All Blacks to kick off. Wilson to kick off. Oh, I can see there the Chairman of the By-ways and Highways Committee who's obviously recovered from that very nasty blow he got in that loose ball in the first half. 

<Direction: opposite them the All Blacks kick off> 

Commentator(John Cleese): And Wilson kicks off and it's the Town Clerk's taken the ball beautifully there, the All Blacks are up on it very fast and the whistle has gone. I'm not quite sure what happened there, I couldn't see, but there's a scrum-down. I think it's an All Blacks' ball. They were upon them very fast. Obviously they're going to try very hard in this half to wipe out this five-point deficit. Derby Council eight points to three up and Derby Council have got the ball against the head. There is the Borough Surveyor, the scrum-half is out of the ... er, the Chairman of the Highway and By-way Committee who's kicked for touch. The line out - and it's into the line out and the Mayor has got the ball again. To the Borough Surveyor who's left out the Medical Officer of Health. Straight along the line to the Lady Mayoress and the Lady Mayoress has got to go through. Number two has missed her - he's taken to the full back - only the full back to beat and she has scored! The Lady Mayoress has scored, it's eleven points to three. 

<Direction: CAPTION: 'NEW ZEALAND 3 DERBY COUNCIL 11' Cut to linkman and Cliff Morgan.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Cliff, this must have been a very disappointing result for the All Blacks. 

<Direction: Welsh> 

Cliff(Graham Chapman): Well, they've had very bad luck on the tour so far. They missed four very easy kicks against the Exeter Amateur Operatic Society, which must have cost them the match and then of course there was that crippling defeat at the hands of the Derry and Toms Soft Toy Department, so I don't think they can be really fancying their chances against the London Pooves on Saturday. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): And what about China? 

Cliff(Graham Chapman): Well, whether Mao Tse Tung is alive or not, Lin Piao has a stranglehold on the central committee which Lin Shao Chi can't break, so it remains to be seen whether Chou En Lai can really get his finger out and get going in the second half. 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Well, thank you Cliff. Tonight's other outstanding match was the semi-final between the Bournemouth Gynaecologists and the Watford Long John Silver Impersonators. We bring you edited highlights of the match. 

<Direction: Rapid montage of goals scored by competent gynaecologists wearing surgical gowns and caps, against totally incompetent and immobile LJSI team who simply stand round going 'aaah! Jim lad' as the goals rain in. The ball is tucked off-screen. Sudden cut to studio. A presenter is standing in front of curtain; he catches the ball thrown from off. He smiles.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well, that's about it for tonight ladies and gentlemen, but remember if you've enjoyed watching the show just half as much as we've enjoyed doing it, then we've enjoyed it twice as much as you. Ha, ha, ha. 

<Direction: The sixteen-ton weight falls on him. Cut to montage of scenes of destruction, buildings falling down, bombs etc. Roll credits over. An office. Boss is reading a book, 'Chinese for Business Men'. He tries out a few Chinese words. There is a knock at the door.> 

Boss(John Cleese): Come in. 

<Direction: Mr Frog comes in> 

Boss(John Cleese): Ah, Frog. 

Frog(Eric Idle): S. Frog, sir. 

Boss(John Cleese): Shut up, I want to have a word with you, Frog. 

Boss(John Cleese): Shut up. It's about your advertising campaign for Conquistador Coffee. Now, I've had the managing director of Conquistador to see me this morning and he's very unhappy with your campaign. Very unhappy. In fact, he's shot himself. 

Frog(Eric Idle): Badly, sir? 

Boss(John Cleese): No, extremely well. 

<Direction: lifts up a leg belonging to a body behind desk, and holds up a card saying 'joke' opens a nearby door; a dead company secretary falls out> 

Boss(John Cleese): , the effect of which was how disappointed he was with your work and, in particular, why you had changed the name from Conquistador Instant Coffee to Conquistador Instant Leprosy. Why, Frog? 

Boss(John Cleese): Shut up. Why did you do it? 

Frog(Eric Idle): It was a joke. 

Boss(John Cleese): A joke? 

<Direction: holds up card saying 'joke'> 

Frog(Eric Idle): No, no not a joke, a sales campaign. 

<Direction: holds up a card saying 'No, a Sales Campaign'> 

Boss(John Cleese): I see, Frog. 

Boss(John Cleese): Shut up. Now, let's have a look at the sales chart. 

<Direction: indicates a plummeting sales graph> 

Boss(John Cleese): When you took over this account, Frog, Conquistador was a brand leader. Here you introduced your first campaign, 'Conquistador Coffee brings a new meaning to the word vomit'. Here you made your special introductory offer of a free dead dog with every jar, and this followed your second campaign 'the tingling fresh coffee which brings you exciting new cholera, mange, dropsy, the clap, hard pad and athlete's head. From the House of Conquistador'. 

Frog(Eric Idle): It was a soft-sell, sir 

Boss(John Cleese): Why, Frog? 

Boss(John Cleese): Shut up! Well? 

Frog(Eric Idle): Well, people know the name, sir. 

Boss(John Cleese): They certainly do know the name - they burnt the factory down. The owner is hiding in my bathroom 

<Direction: shot heard holds up 'joke' card again> 

Frog(Eric Idle): You're not going to fire me, sir? 

Boss(John Cleese): Fire you? Three men dead, the factory burnt down, the account lost and our firm completely bankrupt, what... what... what ... can you possibly say? What excuse can you possibly make? 

Frog(Eric Idle): Sorry, father. 

<Direction: holds up the 'joke' card> 

Boss(John Cleese): Oh, yes. Oh, incidentally your film's won a prize. 

<Direction: He opens a venetian blind on the window to reveal the film: a coastline. Panning shot of hills rolling down into the sea, waves breaking on the shore. Travelogue music. Suddenly the music sticks, and keeps repeating one phrase. The pan continues. We come across an old-fashioned gramophone on which the record is sticking. A hand comes in and lifts the needle off. The pan continues - it's the hand of the announcer who is sitting at his desk.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): Sorry about that. And now for something completely diff... 

<Direction: the film sticks and repeats the end of the sentence several times> 

Announcer(John Cleese): something completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely different. 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's...

Ramsay MacDonald(Michael Palin): My, it's hot in here.

There is a knock at the door. He switches the projector off and hides it furtively. He is sitting in an office, with a placard saying 'Exchange and Mart, Editor' on his desk. He points to it rather obvoiusly.> 

Glans(John Cleese): Hello, come in. 

<Direction: enter Bee, a young aspirant job hunter> 

Glans(John Cleese): Ah, hello, hello, how much do you want for that briefcase? 

Bee(Terry Jones): Well, I... 

Glans(John Cleese): All right then, the briefcase and the umbrella. A fiver down, must be my final offer. 

Bee(Terry Jones): Well, I don't want to sell them. I've come for a job. 

Glans(John Cleese): Oh, take a seat, take a seat. 

Bee(Terry Jones): Thank you. 

Glans(John Cleese): I see you chose the canvas chair with the aluminium frame. I'll throw that in and a fiver, for the briefcase and the umbrella ... no, make it fair, the briefcase and the umbrella and the two pens in your breast pocket and the chair's yours and a fiver and a pair of ex-German U-boat commander's binoculars. 

Bee(Terry Jones): Really, they are not for sale. 

Glans(John Cleese): Not for sale, what does that mean? 

Bee(Terry Jones): I came about the advertisement for the job of assistant editor. 

Glans(John Cleese): Oh yeah, right. Ah, OK, ah. How much experience in journalism? 

Bee(Terry Jones): Five years. 

Glans(John Cleese): Right, typing speed?

Voice Over(Terry Gilliam): So Miss Johnson returned to her typing and dreamed her little dreamy dreams, unaware as she was of the cruel trick fate had in store for her. For Miss Johnson was about to fall victim of the dreaded international Chinese Communist Conspiracy. 

<Direction: lots of little yellow men pour into the office who appears in the animation Miss Johnson is submerged in a tide of yellow men>

<Direction: A sailing ship with American flag sails in over yellow men. Zoom in on the flag: Uncle Sam appears in front of it.> 

Uncle Sam(Terry Gilliam): Yes, once again American defence proves its effectiveness against international communism. Using this diagram of a tooth to represent any small country, we can see how international communism works by eroding away form the inside 

<Direction: diagram of tooth rotting from inside and collapsing the remaining teeth fall sideways into the gap> 

Uncle Sam(Terry Gilliam): In dentistry, this is known as Domino Theory. but with american defence the decay is stopped before it starts and that's why nine out of ten small countries choose American defense ...

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh! Daddy! 

John(Eric Idle): My hat! Sir Horace!

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Has he been... 

John(Eric Idle): Yes - after breakfast. But that doesn't matter now... he's dead. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh! Poor daddy... 

John(Eric Idle): Looks like I shan't be catching the 11.30 now. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh no, John, you mustn't miss your train. 

John(Eric Idle): How could I think of catching a train when I should be here helping you? 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh, John, thank you... anyway you could always catch the 9.30 tomorrow - it goes via Caterham and Chipstead. 

John(Eric Idle): Or the 9.45's even better. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh, but you'd have to change at Lambs Green. 

John(Eric Idle): Yes, but there's only a seven-minute wait now. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Oh, yes, of course, I'd forgotten it was Friday. Oh, who could have done this? 

<Direction: Enter Lady Partridge.> 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): Oh, do hurry Sir Horace, your train leaves in twenty-eight minutes, and if you miss the 10.15 you won't catch the 3.45 which means ... oh! 

John(Eric Idle): I'm afraid Sir Horace won't be catching the 10.15, Lady Partridge. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): Has he been... ? 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): Yes - after breakfast. 

John(Eric Idle): Lady Partridge, I'm afraid you can cancel his seat reservation. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): Oh, and it was back to the engine - fourth coach along so that he could see the gradient signs outside Swanborough. 

John(Eric Idle): Not any more Lady Partridge... the line's been closed. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): Closed! Not Swanborough! 

John(Eric Idle): I'm afraid so. 

<Direction: Enter Inspector Davis.> 

Inspector(Terry Jones): All right, nobody move. I'm Inspector Davis of Scotland Yard. 

John(Eric Idle): My word, you were here quickly, inspector. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Yeah, I got the 8.55 Pullman Express from King's Cross and missed that bit around Hornchurch. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): It's a very good train. 

All(None): Excellent, very good, delightful. 

<Direction: Tony runs in through the french windows. He wears white flannels and boater and is jolly upper-class.> 

Tony(Michael Palin): Hello everyone. 

All(None): Tony! 

Tony(Michael Palin): Where's daddy? 

<Direction: seeing him> 

Tony(Michael Palin): Oh golly! Has he been... ? 

John and Jasmina(Eric Idle): Yes, after breakfast. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Then ... he won't be needing his reservation on the 10.15. 

John(Eric Idle): Exactly. 

Tony(Michael Palin): And I suppose as his eldest son it must go to me. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): Just a minute, Tony. There's a small matter of... murder. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Oh, but surely he simply shot himself and then hid the gun. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): How could anyone shoot himself and then hide the gun without first cancelling his reservation. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Ha, ha! Well, I must dash or I'll be late for the 10.15. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): I suggest you murdered your father for his seat reservation. 

Tony(Michael Palin): I may have had the motive, inspector, but I could not have done it, for I have only just arrived from Gillingham on the 8.13 and here's my restaurant car ticket to prove it. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): The 8.13 from Gillingham doesn't have a restaurant car. 

John(Eric Idle): It's a standing buffet only. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Oh, er... did I say the 8.13, I meant the 7.58 stopping train. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): But the 7.58 stopping train arrived at Swindon at 8.19 owing to annual point maintenance at Wisborough Junction. 

John(Eric Idle): So how did you make the connection with the 8.13 which left six minutes earlier? 

Tony(Michael Palin): Oh, er, simple! I caught the 7.16 Football Special arriving at Swindon at 8.09. 

Jasmina(Carol Cleveland): But the 7.16 Football Special only stops at Swindon on alternate Saturdays. 

Lady Partridge(Graham Chapman): Yes, surely you mean the Holidaymaker Special. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Oh, yes! How daft of me. Of course, I came on the Holidaymaker Special calling at Bedford, Colmworth, Fen Dinon, Sutton, Wallington and Gillingham. 

Inspector(Terry Jones): That's Sundays only! 

Tony(Michael Palin): Damn. All right, I confess I did it. I killed him for his reservation, but you won't take me alive! I'm going to throw myself under the 10.12 from Reading. 

John(Eric Idle): Don't be a fool, Tony, don't do it, the 10.12 has the new narrow traction bogies, you wouldn't stand a chance. 

Tony(Michael Palin): Exactly. 

<Direction: Tableau. Loud chord and slow curtain. That was an excerpt from the latest West End hit 'It all happened on the 11.20 from Hainault to Redhill via Horsham and Reigate, calling at Carshalton Beeches, Malmesbury, Tooting Bec, and Croydon West'. The author is Mr. Neville Shunt. Shunt sitting among mass of railway junk, at typewriter, typing away madly. typing> 

Shunt(Terry Gilliam): Chuff, chuff, chuffwoooooch, woooooch! Sssssssss, sssssssss! Diddledum, diddledum, diddlealum. Toot, toot. The train now standing at platform eight, tch, tch, tch, diddledum, diddledum. Chuffff chuffffiTff eeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa Vooooommmmm. 

<Direction: Cut to art critic. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'GAVIN MILLARRRRRRRRRR'> 

Art Critic(John Cleese): Some people have made the mistake of seeing Shunt's work as a load of rubbish about railway timetables, but clever people like me, who talk loudly in restaurants, see this as a deliberate ambiguity, a plea for understanding in a mechanized world. The points are frozen, the beast is dead. What is the difference? What indeed is the point? The point is frozen, the beast is late out of Paddington. The point is taken. If La Fontaine's elk would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head, the dining car our oesophagus, the guard's van our left lung, the cattle truck our shins, the first-class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon. The clarity is devastating. But where is the ambiguity? It's over there in a box. Shunt is saying the 8.15 from Gillingham when in reality he means the 8.13 from Gillingham. The train is the same only the time is altered. Ecce homo, ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister and knew her bloody well. The point is taken, the beast is moulting, the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is reality, the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only truth. But is the truth, as Hitchcock observes, in the box? No there isn't room, the ambiguity has put on weight. The point is taken, the elk is dead, the beast stops at Swindon, Chabrol stops at nothing, I'm having treatment and La Fontaine can get knotted.

Man(Michael Palin): Gavin Millar...

Another Man(Terry Jones): ...rrrrrrr...

<Direction: Cut to late-night line-up setting. Interviewer and interviewee.> 

Padget(Terry Jones): Martin Curry, welcome. One of the big teeth... big points that the American critics made about your latest film, 'The Twelve Caesars', was that it was on so all-embracing a topic. What made you undertake so enormous a tusk... task? 

<Direction: We now see that his interviewee has two enormous front teeth.> 

Curry(Graham Chapman): Well I've always been interested in Imperial Rome from Julius Caesar right through to Vethpathian. 

Padget(Terry Jones): Who? 

Curry(Graham Chapman): Vethpathian. 

Padget(Terry Jones): Ah! Vespasian. 

Curry(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Padget(Terry Jones): When I saw your film it did seem to me that you had taken a rather, umm, subjective approach to it. 

Curry(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry? 

Padget(Terry Jones): Well, I mean all your main characters had these enormous ... well not enormous, these very big ... well let's have a look at a clip in which Julius Incisor .... Caesar talks to his generals during the battle against Caractacus. 

Curry(Graham Chapman): I don't see that at all.

<Direction: with very large front teeth Thus O Caesar. with amazingly large front teeth> 

Julius(Graham Chapman): Today is about to be a triumph for our native country. 

<Direction: Back to interview set.> 

Padget(Terry Jones): Martin Curry, why do all your characters have these very big er ... very big um ... teeth? 

Curry(Graham Chapman): What do you mean? 

Padget(Terry Jones): Well, I mean, er... and even in your biblical epic, 'The Son of Man', John the Baptist had the most enormous ... dental appendages ... and of course ... himself had the most monumental ivories. 

Curry(Graham Chapman): No, I'm afraid I don't see that at all. 

<Direction: picks up glass of water but can't get it to his mouth> 

Curry(Graham Chapman): Could I have a straw? 

Padget(Terry Jones): Oh, a straw, yes, yes. Well while we're doing that perhaps we could take another look at an earlier film, 'Trafalgar'. 

<Direction: Between decks. Nelson lying among others. They all have enormous teeth.> 

Nelson(Eric Idle): Cover my coat, Mr Bush, the men must not know of this till victory is ours. 

Toad(Terry Jones): The surgeon's coming, sir. 

Nelson(Eric Idle): No, tell the surgeon to attend the men that can be saved. He can do little for me, I fear. 

Toad(Terry Jones): Aye, aye, sir. 

Nelson(Eric Idle): Hardy! Hardy! 

Hardy(Michael Palin): Sir? 

Nelson(Eric Idle): Hardy...kiss... er ... put your hand on my thigh.

Man With Enormous Ears(John Cleese): It wasn't true to life. 

Man With Enormous Teeth(Terry Jones): Yes it was. 

Man With Enormous Nose(Eric Idle): No it wasn't. 

Madly Dressed Man(Graham Chapman): I thought it was totally bizarre. 

First City Gent(Michael Palin): Well I've been in the city for over forty years and I think the importance of looking after poor people cannot be understressed. 

Second City Gent(Graham Chapman): Well I've been in the city for twenty years and I must admit - I'm lost. 

An Old Gramophone(John Cleese): Well, I've been in the city all my life and I'm as alert and active as I've ever been. 

Third City Gent(Eric Idle): Well I've been in the city since I was two and I certainly wouldn't say that I was stuck in a rut... stuck in a rut ... stuck in a rut... stuck in a rut... 

Woman(Terry Jones): Oh dear, Mr Bulstrode's stuck again. 

<Direction: She runs over and gives him a shove.> 

Third City Gent(Eric Idle): I certainly wouldn't say that I was stuck in a rut. 

Fourth City Gent(John Cleese): Well l've been in the city for thirty years and I've never once regretted being a nasty, greedy, cold hearted, avaricious, money-grubber ... Conservative. 

Fifth City Gent(Terry Jones): Well I've been in the city for twenty-seven years and I would like to see the reintroduction of flogging. Every Thursday, round at my place.

<Direction: Cut to Arthur Crackpot sitting at a large curved desk on the front of which a sign says 'Crackpot Religions Ltd. Arthur Crackpot President and God (Ltd)'.> 

Crackpot(Eric Idle): This is an example of the sort of abuse we get all the time from ignorant people. I inherited this religion from my father, an ex-used-car salesman and part-time window-box, and I am very proud to be in charge of the first religion with free gifts. You get this luxury tea-trolley with every new enrollment. 

<Direction: pictures of this and the subsequent gifts> 

Crackpot(Eric Idle): In addition to this you can win a three-piece lounge suite, this luxury caravan, a weekend for two with Peter Bonetti and tonights star prize, the entire Norwich City Council. 

<Direction: Curtains go up to reveal the council. Terrific 'ooh' from an audience. Bad organ chords played by a nude man .> 

Crackpot(Eric Idle): And remember with only eight scoring draws you can win a bishopric in a see of your own choice. You see we have a much more modern approach to religion. 

<Direction: Cut to a person in church. They are walking past a pillar. They take out some money and put it in a collecting box. A sign on the box says 'For the rich'. We hear the money going in, then it moves off, along pipes, falling down; eventually it comes down a small pipe and lands with a tinkle in Crackpot's ashtray. He tries the money with his teeth, pops it into his pocket, and finishes reading...> 

Crackpot(Eric Idle): Blessed is Arthur Crackpot and all his subsidiaries Ltd. You see, in our Church we have a lot more fun.

Priest(John Cleese): Oh, Mrs Collins, you did say you were nervous, didn't you? You have eyes on the coffee machine? 

Mrs Collins(Michael Palin): I don't mind, I don't mind - it's just nice to be here, Reverend.

<Direction: Organ music, oohs and applause from audience.> 

Mrs Collins(Michael Palin): I've got one already. 

<Direction: the priest starts to throttle her Cut back to Crackpot in his Office.> 

Crackpot(Eric Idle): A lot of religions - no names no pack drill - do go for the poorer type of person - face it, there's more of 'em - poor people, thieves, villains, poor people without no money at all - well we don't have none of that. Rich people and crumpet over sixteen can enter free: upper middle class quite welcome; lower middle class not under five grand a year. Lower class - I can't touch it. There's no return on it, you see. 

<Direction: Pull back to show interviewer sitting at his side.>

Voice Over(John Cleese): Sarah, today's diocesan lovely is enough to make any chap go down on his knees. This twenty-three-year-old bishop hails appropriately enough from Bishop's Stortford and lists her hobbies as swimming, riding, and film producers. What a gas! Bet she's no novice when it comes to converting all in her See.

<Direction: Cut to wide-boy Pope, with small moustache and kipper tie. A sign says: 'No Questions Asked Religion '.>

He could be behind the wall, inside the water barrel, beneath a pile of leaves, up in the tree, squatting down behind the car, concealed in a hollow, or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we happen to know he's in the water barrel.

Announcer(John Cleese): Ladies and gentlemen, I am not simply going to say 'and now for something completely different' this week, as I do not think it fit. This is a particularly auspicious occasion for us this evening, as we have been told that Her Majesty the Queen will be watching part of the show tonight. We don't know exactly when Her Majesty will be tuning in. We understand that at the moment she is watching 'The Virginian', but we have been promised that we will be informed the moment that she changes channel. Her majesty would like everyone to behave quite normally but her equerry has asked me to request all of you at home to stand when the great moment arrives, although we here in the studio will be carrying on with our humorous vignettes and spoofs in the ordinary way. Thank you. And now without any more ado and completely as normal, here are the opening titles.

Voice Over(John Cleese): the story of such men, battling gallantly against floods, roof falls, the English criminal law, the hidden killer carbon monoxide and the ever-present threat of pneumoconiosis which is... a disease miners get. 

<Direction: Cut to coal face below ground where some miners are engaged at their work. They hew away for a bit, grunting and talking amongst themselves. Suddenly two of them square up to one another.> 

First Miner(Graham Chapman): Don't you talk to me like that, you lying bastard. 

<Direction: He hits the second miner and a fight starts.> 

Second Miner(Terry
Jones): You bleeding pig. You're not fit to be down a mine. 

First Miner(Graham Chapman): Typical bleeding Rhondda, isn't it. You think you're so bloody clever. 

<Direction: They writhe around on the floor pummelling each other. The foreman comes in.> 

Foreman(Eric Idle): You bloody fighting again. Break it up or I'll put this pick through your head. Now what's it all about? 

First Miner(Graham Chapman): He started it. 

Second Miner(Terry
Jones): Oh, you bleeding pig, you started it. 

Foreman(Eric Idle): I don't care who bloody started it. What's it about? 

Second Miner(Terry
Jones): Well ... he said the bloody Treaty of Utrecht was 1713. 

First Miner(Graham Chapman): So it bloody is. 

Second Miner(Terry
Jones): No it bloody isn't. It wasn't ratified 'til February 1714. 

First Miner(Graham Chapman): He's bluffing. You're mind's gone, Jenkins. You're rubbish. 

Foreman(Eric Idle): He's right, Jenkins. It was ratified September 1713. The whole bloody pit knows that. Look in Trevelyan, page 468. 

Third Miner(Michael Palin): He's thinking of the Treaty of bloody Westphalia. 

Second Miner(Terry
Jones): Are you saying I don't know the difference between the War of the bloody Spanish Succession and the Thirty bloody Years War? 

Third Miner(Michael Palin): You don't know the difference between the Battle of Borodino and a tiger's bum. 

<Direction: They start to fight.> 

Foreman(Eric Idle): Break it up, break it up. 

<Direction: he hits them with his pickaxe> 

Foreman(Eric Idle): I'm sick of all this bloody fighting. If it's not the bloody Treaty of Utrecht it's the bloody binomial theorem. This isn't the senior common room at All Souls, it's the bloody coal face. 

<Direction: A fourth miner runs up.> 

Fourth Miner(Ian Davidson): Hey, gaffer, can you settle something? Morgan here says you find the abacus between the triglyphs in the frieze section of the entablature of classical Greek Doric temples. 

Foreman(Eric Idle): You bloody fool, Morgan, that's the metope. The abacus is between the architrave and the aechinus in the capital. 

Morgan(Terry Gilliam): You stinking liar. 

<Direction: Another fight breaks out. A management man arrives carried in sedan chair by two black flunkies. He wears a colonial governor's helmet and a large sign reading 'frightfully important'. All the miners prostrate themselves on the floor.> 

Foreman(Eric Idle): Oh, most magnificent and merciful majesty, master of the universe, protector of the meek, whose nose we are not worthy to pick and whose very feces are an untrammelled delight, and whose peacocks keep us awake all hours of the night with their noisy lovemaking, we beseech thee, tell thy humble servants the name of the section between the triglyphs in the frieze section of a classical Doric entablature. 

Management Man(John Cleese): No idea. Sorry. 

Foreman(Eric Idle): Right. Everybody out. 

<Direction: They all walk off throwing down tools. Cut to a newsreader's desk.> 

Newsreader(Michael Palin): Still no settlement in the coal mine dispute at Llanddarog. Miners refused to return to work until the management define a metope. Meanwhile, at Dagenham the unofficial strike committee at Fords have increased their demands to thirteen reasons why Henry III was a bad king. And finally, in the disgusting objects international at Wembley tonight, England beat Spain by a plate of braised pus to a putrid heron. And now, the Toad Elevating Moment.

Mr Pudifoot(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Interviewer(Terry
Jones): Have you always said things in a very roundabout way? 

Interviewer(Terry
Jones): Well, I can't help noticing that, for someone who claims to say things in a very roundabout way, your last two answers have very little of the discursive quality about them. 

Mr Pudifoot(Graham Chapman): Oh, well, I'm not very talkative today. It's a form of defensive response to intensive interrogative stimuli. I used to get it badly when I was a boy ... well, I say very badly, in fact, do you remember when there was that fashion for, you know, little poodles with small coats... 

Interviewer(Terry
Jones): Ah, now you're beginning to talk in a roundabout way. 

Mr Pudifoot(Graham Chapman): Oh, I'm sorry. 

Interviewer(Terry
Jones): No, no, no, no. Please do carry on ... because that is in fact why we wanted you on the show. 

Mr Pudifoot(Graham Chapman): I thought it was because you were interested in me as a human being.

Mr Ith(Eric Idle): Yes, it is extremely difficult. 

Interviewer(Terry
Jones): Just a minute, you're a fraud 

Mr Ith(Eric Idle): Oh no. I can speak the third and fourth sentences perfectly normally. 

Interviewer(Terry

<Direction: He throws away the truss. The background changes to blow-up of a fish tank. The adman is sitting at a desk. He pulls a goldfish bowl over.> 

Adman(Eric Idle): Well last week on Fish Club we learnt how to sex a pike ... and this week we're going to learn how to feed a goldfish. Now contrary to what most people think the goldfish has a ravenous appetite. If it doesn't get enough protein it gets very thin and its bones begin to stick out and its fins start to fall off. So once a week give your goldfish a really good meal. Here's one specially recommended by the board of Irresponsible People. First, some cold consommÃ© or a gazpacho 

<Direction: pours it in> 

Adman(Eric Idle): , then some sausages with spring greens, sautÃ©e potatoes and bread and gravy.

Mix in the sound of lovers - the indistinct deep voice, followed by a playful giggle from the girl. At first very distant, but as we continue to pan it increases in volume, until we come to rest on the source of the noise - a tape recorder in front of a bush. After a short paase, the camera tracks round behind this bush where are a couple sitting reading a book each. Pan away from them across afield. In the middle of the pan we come across a smooth, moustachioed little Italian head waiter, in tails etc. We do not stop on him. bowing to camera> 

Waiter(Graham Chapman): I hope you're enjoying the show. 

<Direction: The camera pans to the end of the field where we pick up a man in a long mac crawling on all fours through the undergrowth. We follow him as he occasionaly dodges behind a bush or a tree. He is stealthily tracking something. After a few moments he comes up behind a birdwatcher in deerstalker and tweeds who lies at the top of a small rise, with his binoculars trained. With infinite caution the man in the long mac slides up behind the birdwatcher, then he stretches out a hand and opens the flap of the birdwatcher's knapsack. He pulls out a small white paper bag. Holding his breath, he feels inside the bag and produces a small pie, then a tomato and finally two hard-boiled eggs. He pockets the hard-boiled eggs, puts the rest back and creeps away.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Herbert Mental collects birdwatchers' eggs. At his home in Surrey he has a collection of over four hundred of them.

Feldman(John Cleese): Well, we do it to make sure that you're serious about wanting insurance, I mean, if you're not, you won't spend a couple of months filling up that enormous churn with mmm, so on and so on... 

Martin(Eric Idle): Shall I bring it in? 

Feldman(John Cleese): Good Lord no. Throw it away.

First Doctor(John Cleese): Hurry up ... right! Now, I know some hospitals where you get the patients lying around in bed. Sleeping, resting, recuperating, convalescing. Well, that's not the way we do things here, right! No, you won't be loafing about in bed wasting the doctors' time. You - you horrible little cripple. What's the matter with you? 

Patient(Michael Palin): Fractured tibia, sergeant. 

First Doctor(John Cleese): 'Fractured tibia, sergeant'? 'Fractured tibia, sergeant'? Ooh. Proper little mummy's boy, aren't we? Well, I'll tell you something, my fine friend, if you fracture a tibia here you keep quiet about it! Look at him!

Patient(Michael Palin): Well, at the moment we're building him a holiday home. 

Interviewer's Voice(Eric Idle): What about the nurses? 

Patient(Michael Palin): Well, I don't know about them. They're not allowed to mix with the patients. 

Interviewer's Voice(Eric Idle): Do all the patients work? 

Patient(Michael Palin): No, no, the ones that are really ill do sport.

Voice Over(Eric Idle): As an admiral who came up through the ranks more times than you've had hot dinners, I wish to join my husband Admiral O.W.A Giveaway in condemning this shoddy misrepresentation of our modern navy. The British Navy is one of the finest and most attractive and butchest fighting forces in the world. I love those white flared trousers and the feel of rough blue serge on those pert little buttocks! 

<Direction: Cut to a man at a desk.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): I'm afraid we are unable to show you any more of that letter. We continue with a man with a stoat through his head.

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Thirty-three days, sir. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Thirty-three days? 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): I don't think we can hold out much longer. I don't think I did spoil the atmosphere. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Shut up! 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry, I don't think I did. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Of course you did. 

<Direction: to third Sailor> 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Do you think I spoilt the atmosphere? 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): Well, I think you ...

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): We're done for, we're done for! 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Shut up, Maudling. We've just got to keep hoping someone will find us. 

Fourth Sailor(Terry
Jones): How are you feeling, captain? 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): Not too good ... I ... feel ... so weak. 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): We can't hold out much longer. 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): Listen ... chaps ... there's one last chance. I'm done for, I've got a gammy leg, I'm going fast, I'll never get through ... but ... some of you might ... so you'd better eat me. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Eat you, sir? 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): Yes. Eat me. 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Uuuuggghhh! With a gammy leg? 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): You don't have to eat the leg, Thompson, there's still plenty of good meat ... look at that arm. 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): It's not just the leg, sir. 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): What do you mean? 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): Well, sir ... it's just that ... 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): Why don't you want to eat me? 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): I'd rather eat Johnson, sir. 

<Direction: he points at fourth sailor> 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Oh, so would I, sir. 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): I see. 

Fourth Sailor(Terry

First Sailor(Michael Palin): No, no, it's not just that ... 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): What's the matter with Johnson, sir? 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Well, he's not kosher. 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): That depends how we kill him, sir. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, I see that ... well to be quite frank, I like my meat a little more lean. I'd rather eat Hodges. 

<Direction: cheerfully> 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Oh well ... all right. 

Third Sailor(Eric Idle): No, I'd still prefer Johnson. 

Fifth Sailor(John Cleese): I wish you'd all stop bickering and eat me. 

Second Sailor(Graham Chapman): Look! I'll tell you what. Why don't those of us who want to, eat Johnson, then you, sir, can eat my leg and then we'll make a stock of the Captain and then after that we can eat the rest of Johnson cold for supper. 

First Sailor(Michael Palin): Good thinking, Hodges.

<Direction: Boos off-screen. Cut to a letter> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Dear Sir, I am glad to hear that your studio audience disapproves of the last skit as strongly as I. As a naval officer I abhor the implication that the Royal Navy is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we have the problem relatively under control, and that it is the RAF who now suffer the largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Argylls ate in Aden. Arabs? Yours etc. Captain B.J. Smethwick in a white wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms and garlic. 

<Direction: various nasty cannibalistic scenes from Terry Gilliam. Cut to man.> 

Man(Terry

<Direction: Cut to an undertaker's shop> 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Morning. 

Man(John Cleese): Good Morning. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): What can I do for you, squire? 

Man(John Cleese): Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. You see, my mother has just died. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Ah well, we can help you. We deal with stiffs. 

Man(John Cleese): What? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Well, there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her. 

Man(John Cleese): Dump her? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Dump her in the Thames. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Oh, did you like her? 

Man(John Cleese): Yes! 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what do you think? We can bury her or burn her. 

Man(John Cleese): Well, which do you recommend? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Well, they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead, but quick. 

<Direction: the audience starts booing> 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): and then we give you handful of ashes, which you can pretend are hers. 

Man(John Cleese): Oh. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Or, if we bury her she gets eaten up lots of weevils, and nasty maggots, 

<Direction: the booing increases> 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): which as I said before is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead. 

Man(John Cleese): I see. Well, she's definitely dead. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Where is she? 

Man(John Cleese): She's in this sack. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Can I have a look? She looks quite young. 

Man(John Cleese): Yes, yes, she was. 

<Direction: Increasing protests from audience calling> 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Fred! 

Fred's voice(Eric Idle): Yeah? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): I think we've got an eater. 

<Direction: Another undertaker pokes his head round the door> 

Fred(Eric Idle): Right, I'll get the oven on. 

<Direction: goes off> 

Man(John Cleese): Er, excuse me, um, are you suggesting eating my mother? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Er ... Yeah. Not raw. Cooked. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Yes, roasted with a few french fries, broccoli, horseradish sauce ... 

Man(John Cleese): Well, I do feel a bit peckish. 

Voice From Audience(None): Disgraceful! Boo! 

<Direction: etc.> 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Great! 

Man(John Cleese): Can we have some parsnips? 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Fred - get some parsnips. 

Man(John Cleese): I really don't think I should. 

Undertaker(Graham Chapman): Look, tell you what, we'll eat her, if you feel a bit guilty about it after, we can dig a grave and you can throw up in it. 

<Direction: A section of the audience rises up in revolt and invades the set, remonstrating with the performers and banging the counter, etc., breaking up the sketch. Zoom away from them and into caption machine; roll credits. The National Anthem starts. The shouting stops. Mix through credits to show audience and everyone on set standing to attention. As the credits end, fade out. The camera pans across Glencoe. The wind is whistling and climaxes with a great chord, which introduces... CAPTION: 'NJORL'S SAGA' 'ICELAND 1126' The caption fades. Continue the pan until we pick up Icelandic gentleman. He unravels a scroll and starts to read.> 

Icelandic Gent(Michael Palin): I Eric ... um 

<Direction: The camera pans away from him and picks up a man (Terry J) seated at the organ, his back to the camera. He is naked, and he looks identical to the way he did in that deceased classic of our time 'And now for something completely trivial'. He grins at the camera and plays a few chords. Quick cut to the announcer at his desk.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now ...

Have you anything to say before I pass sentence? 

Randall(Eric Idle): Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. 

Judge(Terry Jones): Very sorry? 

Randall(Eric Idle): Yes, sir. It was a very very bad thing to have done and I'm really very ashamed of myself. I can only say it won't happen again. To have murdered so many people in such a short space of time is really awful, and I really am very, very, very sorry that I did it, and also that I've taken up so much of the court's valuable time listening to the sordid details of these senseless killings of mine. I would particularly like to say, a very personal and sincere 'sorry' to you, m'lud, for my appalling behaviour throughout this trial. I'd also like to say sorry to the police, for putting them to so much trouble 

<Direction: shot of three heavily bandaged exhausted-looking policemen behind him> 

Randall(Eric Idle): for the literally hours of work they've had to put in, collecting evidence and identifying corpses and so forth. You know I think sometimes we ought to realize the difficult and often dangerous work involved in tracking down violent criminals like myself and I'd just like them to know that their fine work is at least appreciated by me. 

<Direction: The policemen look embarrassed.> 

First Policeman(Graham Chapman): No, no, we were only doing our job. 

Second Policeman(None): No, no, no, no. 

Randall(Eric Idle): It's very good of you to say that, but I know what you've been through. 

First Policeman(Graham Chapman): No, no, we've had worse. 

Third Policeman(None): It was plain sailing apart from the arrest. 

Randall(Eric Idle): I know and I'm grateful. I'd like to apologize too to the prosecuting counsel for dragging him in here morning after morning in such lovely weather. 

Counsel(John Cleese): Well, I would have had to come in anyway. 

Randall(Eric Idle): Ah good, but what a presentation of a case! 

Counsel(John Cleese): Oh thank you. 

Randall(Eric Idle): No, no, it's a privilege to watch you in action. I never had a chance. 

Counsel(John Cleese): Oh yes you did. 

Randall(Eric Idle): Not after that summing up. Great. 

<Direction: very chuffed> 

Randall(Eric Idle): And now I must come to the jury. What can I say. I've dragged you in here, day after day, keeping you away from your homes, your jobs, your loved ones, just to hear the private details of my petty atrocities. 

Foreman(Michael Palin): No, no, it was very interesting. 

Randall(Eric Idle): But you could have had a much nicer case. 

Foreman(Michael Palin): No, no, murder's much more fun. 

First Juryman(None): Yes and so many of them. 

Second Juryman(None): Excellent. 

Third Juryman(None): We've had a terrific time. 

<Direction: the jury applauds blows his nose, does a Dickie Attenborough> 

Randall(Eric Idle): I'm sorry, I'm very moved. And so, m'lud, it only remains for you to pass the most savage sentence on me that the law can provide. 

Judge(Terry Jones): Well er... not necessarily. 

Randall(Eric Idle): No, m'lud, the full penalty of the law is hardly sufficient. I insist I must be made an example of. 

Judge(Terry Jones): Well yes and no. I mean society at large... 

Randall(Eric Idle): Oh no, m'lud. Not with mass murder. 

Judge(Terry Jones): But in this case, 

<Direction: to court> 

Judge(Terry Jones): don't you think? 

Court(None): Yes, yes! 

Randall(Eric Idle): Oh, come on, m'lud, you've got to give me life. 

Court(None): No, no, no, no. 

<Direction: to court at large> 

Randall(Eric Idle): Well, ten years at least. 

Judge(Terry Jones): Ten years! 

Court(None): Shame. Shame! 

Randall(Eric Idle): Well five then. Be fair. 

Judge(Terry Jones): No, no. I'm giving you three months. 

Randall(Eric Idle): Oh no, that's so embarrassing. I won't hear of it. Give me six...please. 

Judge(Terry Jones): Well, all right. Six months. 

Randall(Eric Idle): Thank you, m'lud. 

Judge(Terry Jones): But suspended. 

Randall(Eric Idle): Oh no. 

Court(None): Hooray.

<Direction: The whole court shout together. Assaulting a police officer!> 

Prosecuting Counsel(John Cleese): Call Police Constable Pan-Am. 

<Direction: Pan-Am runs into court and starts beating Njorl with a truncheon the policeman gets into box hitting at anyone within range; his colleagues restrain him> 

Prosecuting Counsel(John Cleese): Now, you are Police Constable Pan-Am? 

Constable(Michael Palin): No, I shall deny that to the last breath in my body. 

<Direction: superintendent nods> 

Constable(Michael Palin): Oh. Sorry, yes. 

Prosecuting Counsel(John Cleese): Police constable, do you recognize the defendant? 

Constable(Michael Palin): No. Never seen him before in my life. 

<Direction: the superintendent looks embarrassed> 

Prosecuting Counsel(John Cleese): Constable, will you please tell the court in your own words what happened? 

Constable(Michael Palin): Oh yes! 

<Direction: refers to his notebook points at Njorl the superintendent shakes his head> 

Constable(Michael Palin): No, anyway I clearly saw the deceased... 

Clerk(None): Defendant. 

Constable(Michael Palin): Defendant! Sorry. Sorry, super. I clearly saw the defendant ... doing whatever he's accused of...Red-handed. When kicked... he said: 'It's a fair ... cop, I done it all ... Right... no doubt about... that'. Then, bound as he was to the chair, he assaulted myself and three other constables while bouncing around the cell. The end. 

<Direction: Spontaneous applause from the court. Shouts of 'more! more!'. Pan-am raises his hands and the clapping and shouting dies down.> 

Constable(Michael Palin): Thank you, thank you... and for my next piece of evidence... 

Superintendent(Graham Chapman): I think you'd better leave it there, constable. 

Prosecuting Counsel(John Cleese): Excellent evidence, constable 

<Direction: the constable is removed, flailing his truncheon the while silence from the bandages silence> 

Judge(Terry Jones): Is he in there, d'you think? . .. Hello... Hello! Defendant, are you there ... coo-ee! De-fend-ant... 

Judge(Terry Jones): I think you'd better go and have a look, Maurice. 

Clerk(None): Don't call me Maurice in court! 

Judge(Terry Jones): I'm sorry. 

<Direction: The clerk and prosecuting counsel and two policemen look inside Njorl, who is now in fact a framework of bandages with no one inside. From this oh-so zany situation only Terry 'Marty Feldman's Comedy Machine' Gilliam can save us ...> 

None(None): Animated sketch, leading us into a studio set; a man is sitting in front of a non-animated (but cheap) graph labelled 'Stock Market Report'. 

Voice Over(John Cleese): And now the Stock Market Report by Exchange Telegraph. 

Man(Eric Idle): Trading was crisp at the start of the day with some brisk business on the floor. Rubber hardened and string remained confident. Little bits of tin consolidated although biscuits sank after an early gain and stools remained anonymous. Armpits rallied well after a poor start. Nipples rose dramatically during the morning but had declined by mid-afternoon, while teeth clenched and buttocks remained firm. Small dark furry things increased severely on the floor, whilst rude jellies wobbled up and down, and bounced against rising thighs which had spread to all parts of the country by mid-afternoon. After lunch naughty things dipped sharply forcing giblets upwards with the nicky nacky noo. Ting tang tong rankled dithely, little tipples pooped and poppy things went pong! Gibble gabble gobble went the rickety rackety roo and ...

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Hello, Mrs Premise. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Hello, Mrs Conclusion. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Busy day? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the cat. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Four hours to bury a cat? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes! It wouldn't keep still, wriggling about howling its head off. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Oh - it wasn't dead then? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Well, no, no, but it's not at all a well cat so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday, I thought I'd better bury it just to be on the safe side. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Quite right. You don't want to come back from Sorento to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it now, that's what I say. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): We're going to have our budgie put down. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Really? Is it very old? 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): No. We just don't like it. We're going to take it to the vet tomorrow. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Tell me, how do they put budgies down then? 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Well it's funny you should ask that, but I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or, you can shoot them just there, just above the beak. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Just there! 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Well well well. 'Course, Mrs Essence flushed hers down the loo. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Ooh! No! You shouldn't do that - no that's dangerous. Yes, they breed in the sewers, and eventually you get evil-smelling flocks of huge soiled budgies flying out of people's lavatories infringing their personal freedom. 

<Direction: life-size cut-out of woman at end of last animation goes by> 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Good morning Mrs Cut-out. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): You can't. You can't. I mean, how can I go off and join Frelimo when I've got nine more installments to pay on the fridge. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): No, you can't. You can't. Well this is the whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): No, it bloody isn't. The nub of that is, his characters stand for all of us in their desire to avoid action. Mind you, the man at the off-licence says it's an everyday story of French country folk. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): What does he know? 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Nothing. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an allegory of man's search for commitment. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): No it isn't. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes it is. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Isn't. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): 'Tis. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): All right. We can soon settle this. We'll ask him. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Do you know him? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes, we met on holiday last year. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): In Ibeezer? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes. He was staying there with his wife and Mr and Mr Genet. Oh, I did get on well with Madam S. We were like that. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): What was Jean-Paul like? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Well, you know, a bit moody. Yes, he didn't join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still, Mr Rotter caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion. 

<Direction: she demonstrates> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Le Capitalisme et La Bourgeoisie ils sont la mÃªme chose... Oooh we did laugh. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Well, we'll give him a tinkle then. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes, all right. She said they were in the book. 

<Direction: shouts> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Where's the Paris telephone directory? 

Mrs Inference(Eric Idle): It's on the drier. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): No, no, that's Budapest. Oh here we are Sartre ... Sartre. 

Mrs Varley(Terry Jones): It's 621036. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Oh, thank you, Mrs Varley. 

<Direction: dials as they wait they sing 'The Girl from Ipanema' to Mrs Conclusion to Madame Sartre puts the phone down> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Well he's out distributing pamphlets to the masses but he'll be in at six. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Oh well, I'll ring BEA then. 

<Direction: Cut to them sitting on a raft in mid-ocean.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Oh look, Paris! 

<Direction: Cut to shot of a notice board on the seashore, it reads 'North Malden Welcomes Careful Coastal Craft'.> 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): That's not Paris. Jean-Paul wouldn't live here. It's a right old dump. 

<Direction: 'Alan Whicker', complete with microphone, walks in front of sign.> 

Whicker(Eric Idle): But this is where they were wrong. For this was no old dump, but a town with a future, an urban El Dorado where the businessmen of today can enjoy the facilities of tomorrow in the comfort of yesterday. Provided by a go-getting, go-ahead council who know just how loud money can talk. 

<Direction: a phone off-screen starts to ring> 

Whicker(Eric Idle): Interest rates are so low... 

<Direction: Cut to head of drama's office; he is on the phone.> 

Head of Drama(John Cleese): Well it's none of my business but we had the same trouble with one of our Icelandic sagas. These people are terribly keen but they do rather tend to take over. I think I'd stick to Caribbean Islands if I were you. 

<Direction: rings off> 

Head of Drama(John Cleese): Fine... and now back to the saga. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'NJORL'S SAGA - PART IV'

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Here - this is not Paris, this is Iceland. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Oh, well, Paris must be over there then. 

<Direction: points out to the sea; they walk back to the raft Stock shot of Eiffel Tower. French accordion music. Mix through to French street thronged by old Frenchmen with berets and loaves. Mrs Conclusion and Mrs Premise appear and walk up to the front door of an apartment block. On the front door is a list of the inhabitants of the block. They read it out loud.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Oh, here we are, Number 25 ....

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Flat 1, Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Flat 2, Yves Montand, Flat 3, Jacques Cousteau, Flat 4, Jean Genet and Friend, Flat 5, Maurice Laroux... 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Who's he? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Never heard of him. Flat 6, Marcel Marceau, 'Walking Against the Wind' Ltd. Flat 7, Indira Gandhi? 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): She gets about a bit, doesn't she? 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Yes, Flat 8, Jean-Paul and Betty-Muriel Sartre. 

<Direction: She rings the bell. A voice comes from the intercom. Oui.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): C'est nous, Betty-Muriel, excusez que nous sorerues en retard. 

Voice(None): Entrez. 

<Direction: Buzzer sounds.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Oui, merci. 

<Direction: Interior the Sartres flat. It is littered with books and papers. We hear Jean-Paul coughing. Mrs Sartre goes to the door. She is a ratbag with a fag in her mouth and a duster over her head. A French song is heard on the radio. She switches it off.> 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Oh, rubbish. 

<Direction: opens the door> 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Bonjour. 

<Direction: entering> 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Parlez vous Anglais? 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Oh yes. Good day. 

<Direction: Mrs Premise comes in> 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Hello, love! 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Hello! Oh this is Mrs Conclusion from No. 46. 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Nice to meet you, dear. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Hello. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): How's the old man, then? 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Oh, don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding moods. 'The bourgeoisie this is the bourgeoisie that' - he's like a little child sometimes. I was only telling the Rainiers the other day - course he's always rude to them, only classy friends we've got - I was saying solidarity with the masses I said... pie in the sky! Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs Conclusion? 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): No, I'm a Revisionist. 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Oh good. I mean, look at this place! I'm at my wits end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you couldn't get in here for propaganda. 

<Direction: Shot of a goat eating leaflets in corner of room.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Oh very well. Can we pop in and have a word with him? 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): Yes come along. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Thank you. 

Mrs Sartre(Michael Palin): But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's as good as gold in the morning, I've got to hand it to him, but come lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinaire - six glasses and he's ready to agitate. 

<Direction: Mrs Premise and Mrs Conclusion knock on the door of Jean-Paul's room.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. Oh pardon ... c'est mÃªme nous... 

<Direction: They enter. We do not see Jean-Paul although we hear his voice. Oui.> 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): Jean-Paul. Your famous trilogy 'Rues Ã  LibertÃ©, is it an allegory of man's search for commitment? 

Jean-Paul(None): Oui. 

Mrs Premise(John Cleese): I told you so. 

Mrs Conclusion(Graham Chapman): Oh coitus.

None(None): CAPTION: 'WHICKER'S WORLD' 

<Direction: Various Whickers pace past the camera.> 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): Today we look at a vanishing race. A problem people who are fast disappearing off the face of the earth. 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): A race who one might say are losing a winning battle. 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): They live in a sunshine paradise, a Caribbean dream, where only reality is missing. 

Fourth Whicker(Graham Chapman): For this is Whicker Island. 

Fifth Whicker(John Cleese): An island inhabited entirely by ex-international interviewers in pursuit of the impossible dream. 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): The whole problem of Whicker Island is here in a nutshell. 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): There are just too many Whickers. 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): The light-weight suits. 

Fourth Whicker(Graham Chapman): The old school tie. 

Fifth Whicker(John Cleese): The practised voice of the seasoned campaigner. 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): Cannot hide the basic tragedy here. 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): There just aren't enough rich people left to interview. 

<Direction: Cut to a different location.> 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): You can't teach an old dog new tricks and so 

<Direction: turning to a swimming pool with lots of Whickers around it, wandering with stick mikes and muttering> 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): you find them...

Fourth Whicker(Graham Chapman): Sitting beside elegant swimming pools... 

<Direction: seated at drinks table, with sun umbrella> 

Fifth Whicker(John Cleese): ... sipping Martinis... 

<Direction: standing by the pool> 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): .. and waiting for the inevitable interview. 

<Direction: standing fully clothed in the pool> 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): I talked to the island's only white man, Father Pierre. 

<Direction: Cut to a different location. Feeling of heat. The third Whicker stands beside a priest in a white robe.> 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): Father Pierre, why did you stay on in this colonial Campari-land where the clink of glasses mingles with the murmur of a million mosquitoes, where waterfalls of whisky wash away the worries of a world-weary Whicker, where gin and tonic jingle in a gyroscopic jubilee of something beginning with J - Father Pierre, why did you stay on here? 

<Direction: putting on a pair of Whicker-style glasses> 

Father Pierre(Graham Chapman): Well mainly for the interviews. 

Fifth Whicker(John Cleese): Well there you have it, a crumbling... 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): ... empire in the sun-drenched... 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): Caribbean, where the clichÃ©s sparkle on the waters... 

Third Whicker(Michael Palin): ... like the music of repeat fees... 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): And so... 

Fifth Whicker(John Cleese): ... from Whicker Island... 

First Whicker(Eric Idle): ... it's... 

Second Whicker(Terry Jones): ... fare...

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Who, a year ago, had heard of Mr and Mrs Brian Norris of 37, Gledhill Gardens, Parsons Green? And yet their epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr Norris set out to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek north. No newcomer to this field, Mr Norris's 'A Short History of Motor Traffic Between Purley and Esher' had become a best-selling minor classic in the car-swapping belt. 

<Direction: shot of Mr Norris gazing into a window, where his book lies; there is a sign saying 'Remaindered' split-screen shot of two identical semi-detached houses similarly, dressed suburbanites on other side of the split screen> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): and thirdly, the similarity of speech. 

<Direction: Split screen.> 

Man on Right(Terry Jones): Are you still running the GDBDMDB? 

Man on Left(Eric Idle): Yes, but I've had the excess nipples woppled to remove tamping. 

Man on Right(Terry Jones): Jolly good. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Were these just coincidences, or were they, as Mr Norris believed, part of an identical cultural background? One further discovery convinced him. 

<Direction: cut to two lawnmowers arranged on a table, as if they were exhibits in a museum, with type-written documentation in front of them for the visitor> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): The lawnmower. Surely such a sophisticated household gadget could not have been generated independently in two separate areas. Mr Norris was convinced. 

Mr Norris's Voice(Michael Palin): I'm convinced. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But how to prove it. 

Mr Norris's Voice(Michael Palin): But how to prove it. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): There was only one way to see if the journey between Surbiton and Hounslow was possible, and that was to try and make it. Months of preparation followed whilst Mr Norris continued his research in the Putney Public Library, 

<Direction: Mr Norris in a library reading a book titled 'The Lady with the Naked Skin' by Paul Fox Jnr> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): and Mrs Norris made sandwiches. 

<Direction: Cut to Mr and Mrs Norris leaving their home.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Finally, by April, they were ready. On the 23rd, Mr and Mrs Norris set out from 'Abide-A-Wee' to motor the fifteen miles to Surbiton, watched by a crowd of local well-wishers. 

<Direction: one tiny child holding a small British flag quick flash of them sitting in the window of a Golden Egg or Wimpy place> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): This would be the last they'd see of civilization. Mr Norris's diary for the 23rd reveals the extraordinary calmness and deep inner peacefulness of his mind. 

<Direction: We see the diary.> 

Mr Norris's Voice(Michael Palin): 7.30 Fed cat. 

Mr Norris's Voice(None): 8.00 Breakfast. 

Mr Norris's Voice(None): 8.30 Yes (successfully). 

Mr Norris's Voice(None): 9.00 Set out on historic journey. 

<Direction: Cut to Mr Norris's car driving along a suburban road. A sign says 'You are now leaving Surbiton, gateway to Esher'.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): On the morning of the 24th, early to avoid the traffic, Mr Norris's historic expedition set out from Surbiton - destination Hounslow. Early on they began to perceive encouraging signs. 

<Direction: cut to sign saying 'Hounslow 25 miles'; Mr Norris closely examines the sign, as would an archaeologist badly shot pictures of sandwiches, with fingers in the lens, etc. chord; Mr Norris points excitedly, pull back to reveal him standing on a bridge over the Kingston by-pass examining it through field glasses cut to a map, it traces the two routes in red as the voice talks the car at a river bank; Mr and Mrs Norris puzzling; behind them three or four bridges with traffic pouring over cut to a sign saying Metropolitan Railway cut to them getting on the train a sign saying 'Hounslow Central'; Mr Norris sticks a British flag on the platform; he poses for his wife's photos; much hand shaking cut to Mr Norris's eyes and furrowed brow zoom in on railway timetable on wall saying 'Trains to Surbiton every half hour'> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): 'Wrong Way' Norris had accidentally stumbled on a piece of anthropological history. It was the inhabitants of Hounslow who had made the great trek south to the sunnier pastures of Surbiton, and not vice versa, as he had originally surmised. This was the secret of Surbiton! Happy and contented Mr Norris returned to the calmer waters of chartered accountancy, for, in his way, 'Wrong Way' Norris was right.

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Knock, enter and approach. 

<Direction: knock on door; it opens and three schoolboys in short trousers enter> 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Right, it's come to my notice that certain boys have been running a unit-trust linked assurance scheme with fringe benefits and full cash-in endowment facilities. Apparently small investors were attracted by the wide-ranging portfolio and that in the first week the limited offer was oversubscribed eight times. 

Stebbins(Eric Idle): It was Tidwell's idea, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Shut up, Stebbins! I haven't finished. Oh, by the way, congratulations on winning the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. 

Stebbins(Eric Idle): Thank you, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Shut up. Now then, this sort of extra-curricular capitalist expansion has got to stop. I made it quite clear when Potter tried to go public last term, that these massive stock exchange deals must not happen in Big School. Is that clear, Balderston? 

Balderston(Terry Gilliam): Yes, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Oh, and Balderston, next time you do a 'Panorama' Report on the Black Ghettos you 

Headmaster(None): must 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): get an exeat form from Mr Dibley. 

Balderston(Terry Gilliam): Sorry, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Shut up, and stop slouching. Now, the reason I called you in here today, is that my wife is having a little trouble with her,.. er... with her waterworks, and I think she needs a bit of attention. Now, which one of you is the surgeon? 

<Direction: silence Tidwell raises hand reluctantly> 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Ah! Tidwell. Good. Well, I want you to come along and have a look at the wife. 

Tidwell(Terry Jones): Oh, sir! Why don't you ask Stebbins? He's a gynaecologist. 

Stebbins(Eric Idle): Ooh! You rotten stinker, Tidwell! 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Is this true, Stebbins? Are you a gynaecologist? 

<Direction: very reluctantly> 

Stebbins(Eric Idle): Yes, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Right, just the man. How much do you charge? 

<Direction: muttering into his shoes> 

Stebbins(Eric Idle): Thirty guineas, sir. 

Headmaster(Michael Palin): Excellent. Right. I want you to go along to see the wife. Give her a full examination, and let me know the results by the end of break. And don't pick your nose!

Alan(John Cleese): Hello. 

Noel(Graham Chapman): Hello. 

Alan(John Cleese): Well, last week we showed you how to become a gynaecologist. And this week on 'How to do it' we're going to show you how to play the flute, how to split an atom, how to construct a box girder bridge, how to irrigate the Sahara Desert and make vast new areas of land cultivatable, but first, here's Jackie to tell you all how to rid the world of all known diseases. 

Jackie(Eric Idle): Hello, Alan. 

Alan(John Cleese): Hello, Jackie. 

Jackie(Eric Idle): Well, first of all become a doctor and discover a marvellous cure for something, and then, when the medical profession really starts to take notice of you, you can jolly well tell them what to do and make sure they get everything right so there'll never be any diseases ever again. 

Alan(John Cleese): Thanks, Jackie. Great idea. How to play the flute. 

<Direction: picking up a flute> 

Alan(John Cleese): Well here we are. You blow there and you move your fingers up and down here. 

Noel(Graham Chapman): Great, great, Alan. Well, next week we'll be showing you how black and white people can live together in peace and harmony, and Alan will be over in Moscow showing us how to reconcile the Russians and the Chinese. So, until next week, cheerio. 

Alan(John Cleese): Bye. 

Jackie(Eric Idle): Bye. 

<Direction: Children's music. Pull out to reveal that the 'Blue Peter' set is in one corner of a stockbroker-belt sitting room. Two ladies are sitting by the fire looking at a photo album.> 

Mrs Nigger-Baiter(Michael Palin): Oh, yes, he's such a clever little boy, just like his father. 

Mrs S(Terry Jones): D'you think so, Mrs Nigger-Baiter? 

Mrs Nigger-Baiter(Michael Palin): Oh yes, spitting image.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter(Michael Palin): Ooh, he's a clever little boy - he's a clever little boy.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter(Michael Palin): Do you like your rattle? Do you like your rattle? Look at his little eyes following it ... look at his iggy piggy piggy little eyeballs eh... oo... he's got a tubby tum-tum. Oh, he's got a tubby tum-tum. 

<Direction: whilst Mrs Nigger-Baiter is talking> 

Son(John Cleese): Mother, could I have a quick cup of tea please. I have an important statement on Rhodesia to make in the Commons at six. 

<Direction: Sound of an explosion out of vision. Cut to reveal Mrs Nigger-Baiter's chair charred and smoking. Mrs Nigger-Baiter is no longer there. The upholstery is smouldering gently.> 

Mrs S(Terry Jones): Oh, Mrs Nigger-Baiter's exploded. 

Son(John Cleese): Good thing, too. 

Mrs S(Terry Jones): She was my best friend. 

Son(John Cleese): Oh, mother, don't be so sentimental. Things explode every day. 

Mrs S(Terry Jones): Yes, I suppose so. Anyway, I didn't really like her that much. 

<Direction: The doorbell rings. Mrs S goes to the door. A vicar with a suitcase.> 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Hello, I'm your new vicar. Can I interest you in any encyclopaedias? 

Mrs S(Terry Jones): Ah, no thank you. We're not Church people, thank you.

Doctor(Graham Chapman): This is where Mrs Shazam was so wrong. Exploding is a perfectly normal medical phenomenon. In many fields of medicine nowadays, a dose of dynamite can do a world of good.

Doctor(Graham Chapman): No thank you, vicar. Good morning. 

Vicar(Eric Idle): Oh, morning. 

<Direction: He shuts the door.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Now, many of the medical profession are sceptical about my work. They point to my record of treatment of athlete's foot sufferers - eighty-four dead, sixty-five severely wounded and twelve missing believed cured. But then, people laughed at Bob Hope, people laughed at my wife when she wrapped herself up in greaseproof paper and hopped into the Social Security office, but that doesn't mean that Pasteur was wrong!

<Direction: singing policemen escort the man out And was the holy lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures seen. ANIMATION: bouncing Queen Victoria. Meanwhile in the jungle next door. A steamy tropical jungle. A native guide leads four explorers in pith helmets and old-fashioned long shorts through the jungle. Cicada sounds and shrieks of predatory jungle birds. Intercut close ups of perspiring foreheads etc. The native guide keeps beckoning them to hurry. The jungle appears to get thicker: they have to push their way through the undergrowth. Finally the guide stops and points, with eyes staring. The four explorers cluster around and look over his shoulder. A neat clearing in the thick of the jungle. Tables set as in a London bistro with check cloths and big wooden pepper mills, candles and menus standing on each table. Sitting at the tables are six other explorers in pith helmets etc., eating and chatting. Clink of coffee cups.> 

First Explorer(John Cleese): What a simply super little place! 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Yes, they've done wonders with it. You know this used to be one of the most swampy disease infested areas of the whole jungle, and they've turned it into this smashing little restaurant. 

<Direction: across the restaurant the head waiter appears, dressed in black tie and tails just a bit too big for him; he beckons them to a table> 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Here you are Omkami, thank you. Hello, Mr Akwekwe. 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Hello, Mr Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The-Shirt. Nice to see you again. 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): These are some of my fellow explorers: Sir Charles Farquarson, Brian Bailey, Betty Bailey and this is Mr Akwekwe, who started the whole place. 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): It really is super. 

<Direction: who is dressed as a man and has a moustache> 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): Terrific idea. 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): May I recommend the alligator purees. 

<Direction: Suddenly there is a hideous scream. We see a gorilla tear a man from his table at the back of the restaurant, in front of a tree and drag him back into the jungle. Awful shrieks are heard. Akwekwe runs into the jungle shouting, Terrible sounds of the unseen fight. Thrashing about of bushes in the distance. A shot rings out. Then silence also rings out. Akwekwe emerges, dragging the inert body of the customer whom he puts back in his chair. He slumps forward. Akwekwe comes back to the table in the foreground which has remained in the foreground throughout this preceding shot, with cut ins of the four explorers looking through the menu. Akwekwe has a bloodstained claw mark right across his face and chest and his dicky is torn and bloodstained.> 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Now then, have you decided? 

<Direction: He produces a notepad such as waiters always carry.> 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Ye-es ... Well there's two avocado vinaigrette here and what are you going to have Brian? 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): Er quiche lorraine for me, please. 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Right, so that's two avocado, one quiche ... 

<Direction: Cut to close up of pygmy's evil face parting leaves and firing a blow-pipe. Cut to another table where two explorers are having coffee and cigars. One of them stiffens and then slumps firward. Cut to Akwekwe at the main table registering what has happened. We pan with him as he rushes over to the bushes. Sound of pygmies retreating into the bushes. Akwekwe shouts after him. We pan with Akwekwe as he walks over to the table where the customer has slumped forward. He pulls him up, looks at dart sticking out of his chest, tut tuts with annoyance and lets him slump back on to the table again. He returns to the main table.> 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): So, that's two avocado, one quiche ... 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): And a soup of the day. 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Right. 

<Direction: sinister sound of jungle drums in distance; close up of look of fear in Akwekwe's eyes> 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): And to follow? 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Two chicken Ã  la reine, with sauce provenÃ§ale. 

First Explorer(John Cleese): And one scampi desirÃ©e. 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): And boeuf bourguignon with a green salad. 

<Direction: Jungle drums getting louder. Akwekwe shouts off towards the back of the clearing where we assume the kitchens mast be.> 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with green salad! 

<Direction: He casts yet another fearful glance in the direction of the ever-increasing drum beats.> 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): There may be ... a little delay. 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): That's fine but we have to be out by three. 

Akwekwe(Michael Palin): Yes, sir. Yes, we'll try. 

<Direction: The drum beats get louder. Shot of forest, rustling of bushes. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes. Another shot of forest. Drum beats louder. More rustling. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes and sweating forehead. Forest again and more noise. Close up of Akwekwe; he now has blood on his face, his eyes dilate with fear, the drum beats become deafening. Sudden cut to BBC world symbol.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing. It contains scenes of violence, involving people's heads and arms getting chopped off, their ears nailed to trees, and their toenails pulled out in slow motion. There are also scenes of naked women with floppy breasts, and also at one point you can see a pair of buttocks and there's another bit where I'll swear you can see everything, but my friend says it's just the way he's holding the spear. 

<Direction: pulling himself together> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Because of the unsuitability of the scene, the BBC will be replacing it with a scene from a repeat of 'Gardening Club' for 1958. 

<Direction: A beautiful well-stocked garden bed. 'Gardening Club' music. After two seconds there are shrieks of licentious and lustful laughter. A nude woman pursues a city gent, both screaming with pleasure, into the middle of the flowerbed and they roll around smashing up the flowers in unbridled erotic orgy. Immediately two nuns run in to join the fun, followed by two Vikings, a gumby, a pantomime goose, etc. The whole of this orgy is speeded up.> 

None(None): CAPTION: 'KEN RUSSELL'S GARDENING CLUB 

<Direction: 1958> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And now back to the story. 

<Direction: Cut to the edge of the jungle. Emerging from the dense undergrowth are two pygmy warriors pulling the four explorers who are roped together. The pygmies carry spears. We lose the pygmies and hold just the explorers in frame, and track with them.> 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): That was a nasty business back at the restaurant. 

First Explorer(John Cleese): Yes, I thought most places took Barclaycard nowadays. 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Where do you think they're taking us, Brian? 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): God knows! 

<Direction: pointing, eyes wide with amazement> 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): Look! 

<Direction: Cut to a stock shot of a volcano. Thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers. filled with awe>

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): No, no, no, next to that.

First Explorer(John Cleese): The London Brick Company? 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): No, no, no, no - next to that. 

<Direction: Cut to stock shot of plateau of Roiurama. Yet another thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.> 

First Explorer(John Cleese): The forbidden plateau of Roiurama, the Lost World, thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of millions of years ago, where strange primeval creatures defying evolution, lurk in the dark, impenetrable forests, cut off forever from the outside world. 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): I still can't see it. 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): You don't think that's where they're taking us? 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): Yes, and God knows what we'll find there. 

<Direction: A pigmy native rushes up from behind them, holding a script.> 

Native(Michael Palin): What page please? 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): What? 

<Direction: with a trace of irritation> 

Native(Michael Palin): What page in the script? 

<Direction: whispered> 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): Page 7. 

<Direction: he speaks the lines over to himself tries with eyes shut throws away the script, starts to push them roughly> 

Native(Michael Palin): Come on you dogs, we have time to lose, this has gone too far. 

<Direction: Stock film of Houses of Parliament from across the Thames.> 

Voice Over(Graham Chapman): Meanwhile back in London ... at the British Explorers' Club in the Mall... 

<Direction: Cut to the leather-armchaired hallway of a London club. In four of the chairs sit men in polar explorers' kit - furs, iced-over goggles, etc. - reading newspapers. At one chair sits a man in Norfolk jacket and plus fours. Around his neck he wears a sign saying 'Our Hero'. He is reading a newspaper but obviously has something else on his mind. Suddenly he throws the paper down and gets up. He walks over to the porter's desk. As he does this a polar expedition with four huskies, a sled, and two explorers pass him. Our Hero goes up to the desk. A whiskery old porter stands behind it.> 

Our Hero(Terry Jones): Any news of Betty Bailey's expedition, Hargreaves?

Our Hero(Terry Jones): The Lost World of Roiurama. 

Hargreaves(Michael Palin): Yes sir, we've got a telegram. 

Our Hero(Terry Jones): Oh 

<Direction: reads it> 

Hargreaves(Michael Palin): Reads it. Expedition superb. Weather excellent. Everything wonderful. 

Our Hero(Terry Jones): I wonder what's gone wrong. 

Hargreaves(Michael Palin): For God's sake be careful... 

<Direction: irritably> 

Our Hero(Terry Jones): Wait a minute... I'm going to go... after them. 

Hargreaves(Michael Palin): For God's sake be careful, sir. 

<Direction: Cut to film of the lost world. Tropical South American vegetation. Our four explorers from Jungle Restaurant and Ken Russell's Gardening Club sketches limp along exhaustedly.> 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): My God, Betty, we're done for... 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): We'll never get out of here... we're completely lost, lost. Even the natives have gone. 

First Explorer(John Cleese): Goodbye Betty, Goodbye Farquarson. Goodbye Brian. It's been a great expedition... 

<Direction: Music. Cut to engraving of Crystal Palace. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'CRYSTAL PALACE 1851' Cut immediately back to jungle.> 

First Explorer(John Cleese): Great expedition ... 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): All that'll be left of us will be a map, a compass and a few feet of film, recording our last moments... 

First Explorer(John Cleese): Wait a moment! 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): What is it? 

First Explorer(John Cleese): If we're on film, there must be someone filming us. 

Second Explorer(Eric Idle): My God, Betty, you're right! 

<Direction: They all look around, then gradually all notice the camera. They break out in smiles of relief, come towards the camera and greet the camera crew.> 

Third Explorer(Graham Chapman): Look! Great to see you! 

First Explorer(John Cleese): What a stroke of luck! 

Camera Crew(None): Hello! ... 

First Explorer(John Cleese): Wait a minute! 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): What is it again? 

First Explorer(John Cleese): If this is the crew who were filming us . .. who's filming us now? Look! 

<Direction: Cut to another shot which indudes the first camera crew and yet another camera crew with all their equipment. The director is dressed the same as Yakomoto, the director in 'Erizabeth L', only he is blacked up. African accent> 

Director(Terry Jones): Cut there man! No! No good! How we going to get feeling of personal alienation of self from society with this load of Bulldog Drummond crap? When I was doing 'La Notte' wi' dat Monica Vitti gal she don't gimme none of this empire building shit, man ... 

<Direction: Camera pans slightly to reveal a door in jungle. It opens and an inspector enters.> 

Inspector(Eric Idle): Not so fast, Akarumba! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Baboon of Scotland Yard's Special Fraud Film Director Squad, Jungle Division. 

Fourth Explorer(Carol Cleveland): Baboon of the Yard! 

Inspector(Eric Idle): Shut up!

Man(Michael Palin): I'd like to have an argument please. 

Receptionist(None): Certainly, sir. Have you been here before...? 

Man(Michael Palin): No, this is my first time. 

Receptionist(None): I see. Do you want to have the full argument, or were you thinking of taking a course? 

Man(Michael Palin): Well, what would be the cost? 

Receptionist(None): Yes, it's one pound for a five-minute argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten. 

Man(Michael Palin): Well, I think it's probably best if I start with the one and see how it goes from there. OK? 

Receptionist(None): Fine. I'll see who's free at the moment ... Mr. Du-Bakey's free, but he's a little bit conciliatory ... yes, try Mr. Barnard - Room 12. 

Man(Michael Palin): Thank you. 

<Direction: The man walks down a corridor. He opens door 12. There is a man at a desk. shouting> 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): What do you want? 

Man(Michael Palin): Well I was told outside ... 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): Don't give me that you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings! 

Man(Michael Palin): What! 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): Shut your festering gob you tit! Your type makes me puke! You vacuous toffee-nosed malodorous pervert! 

Man(Michael Palin): Look! I came here for an argument. 

<Direction: calmly> 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): Oh! I'm sorry, this is abuse. 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh I see, that explains it. 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): No, you want room 12A next door. 

Man(Michael Palin): I see - sorry. 

<Direction: exits> 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): Not at all. 

<Direction: as he goes> 

Mr Barnard(Graham Chapman): Stupid git. 

<Direction: Outside 12A. The man knocks on the door. from within> 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Come in. 

<Direction: The man enters the room. Mr Vibrating is sitting at a desk.> 

Man(Michael Palin): Is this the right room for an argument? 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I've told you once. 

Man(Michael Palin): No you haven't. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Yes I have. 

Man(Michael Palin): When? 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Just now! 

Man(Michael Palin): No you didn't. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Yes I did! 

Man(Michael Palin): Didn't. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Did. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I'm telling you I did! 

Man(Michael Palin): You did not! 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour? 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh ... Just a five-minute one. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Fine 

<Direction: makes a note of it; the man sists down> 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): thank you. Anyway, I did. 

Man(Michael Palin): You most certainly did not. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Now, let's get one thing quite clear. I most definitely told you! 

Man(Michael Palin): You did not. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Yes I did. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Yes I did!! 

Man(Michael Palin): Look, this isn't an argument. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Yes it is. 

Man(Michael Palin): No it isn't, it's just contradiction. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No it isn't. 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes it is. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): It is not. 

Man(Michael Palin): It is. You just contradicted me. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No I didn't. 

Man(Michael Palin): Ooh, you did! 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No, no, no, no, no. 

Man(Michael Palin): You did, just then. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No, nonsense! 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh, look this is futile. 

Man(Michael Palin): I came here for a good argument. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No you didn't, you came here for an argument. 

Man(Michael Palin): Well, an argument's not the same as contradiction. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): It can be. 

Man(Michael Palin): No it can't. An argument is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition. 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes it is. It isn't just contradiction. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position. 

Man(Michael Palin): But it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'. 

Man(Michael Palin): No it isn't, Argument is an intellectual process ... contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Not at all. 

Man(Michael Palin): Now look! 

<Direction: pressing the bell on his desk> 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): That's it. Good morning. 

Man(Michael Palin): But I was just getting interested. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Sorry the five minutes is up. 

Man(Michael Palin): That was never five minutes just now! 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I'm afraid it was. 

Man(Michael Palin): No it wasn't. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to argue any more. 

Man(Michael Palin): What!? 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): If you want me to go on arguing you'll have to pay for another five minutes. 

Man(Michael Palin): But that was never five minutes just now ... oh Come on! 

<Direction: Vibrating looks round as though man was not there> 

Man(Michael Palin): This is ridiculous. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I'm very sorry, but I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid. 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh. all right. 

<Direction: pays> 

Man(Michael Palin): There you are. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Thank you. 

Man(Michael Palin): Well?. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Well what? 

Man(Michael Palin): That was never five minutes just now. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid! 

Man(Michael Palin): I've just paid. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No you didn't. 

Man(Michael Palin): I did! I did! I did! 

Man(Michael Palin): Look I don't want to argue about that. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Well I'm very sorry but you didn't pay. 

Man(Michael Palin): Aha! Well if I didn't pay, why are you arguing ... got you! 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): No you haven't. 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes I have ... if you're arguing I must have paid. 

Mr Vibrating(John Cleese): Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time. 

Man(Michael Palin): I've had enough of this. 

Man(Michael Palin): Oh shut up! 

<Direction: he leaves and sees a door marked complaints; he goes in> 

Man(Michael Palin): I want to complain. 

Man in charge(Eric Idle): You want to complain ... look at these shoes ... I've only had them three weeks and the heels are worn right through. 

Man(Michael Palin): No, I want to complain about ... 

Man in charge(Eric Idle): If you complain nothing happens ... you might just as well not bother. My back hurts and ... 

<Direction: the man exits, walks down the corridor and enters a room 'Spreaders' who is just inside the door hits man on the head with a mallet> 

Man(Michael Palin): Ooh! 

Spreaders(Terry Jones): No, no, no, hold your head like this, and then go 'waaagh'! Try it again. 

<Direction: he hits him again> 

Man(Michael Palin): Waaghh! 

Spreaders(Terry Jones): Better. Better. But 'waaaaaghh'! 'Waaaagh'! Hold your hands here ...

Spreaders(Terry Jones): Waagh! 

Fox(Graham Chapman): He's good! You could learn a thing or two from him. Right now you two me old beauties, you are nicked. 

Man(Michael Palin): What for? 

Fox(Graham Chapman): I'm charging you under Section 21 of the Strange Sketch Act. 

Man(Michael Palin): The what? 

Fox(Graham Chapman): You are hereby charged that you did wilfully take part in a strange sketch, that is, a skit, spoof or humorous vignette of an unconventional nature with intent to cause grievous mental confusion to the Great British Public.

Fox(Graham Chapman): Evening all. 

Spreaders(Terry Jones): It's a fair cop.

Now I'm arrestin' this entire show on three counts: one, acts of self-conscious behaviour contrary to the 'Not in front of the children' Act, two, always saying 'It's so and so of the Yard' every time the fuzz arrives and, three, and this is the cruncher, offenses against the 'Getting out of sketches without using a proper punchline' Act, four, namely, simply ending every bleedin' sketch by just having a policeman come in and... wait a minute. 

<Direction: Another policeman enters.> 

Policeman(John Cleese): Hold it.

Man(Eric Idle): Staht sit sepreicly. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): And I believe you're working on an anagram version of Shakespeare? 

Man(Eric Idle): Sey, sey - taht si crreoct, er. Ta the mnemot I'm wroking on 'The Mating of the Wersh'. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): 'The Mating of the Wersh'?  By William Shakespeare? 

Man(Eric Idle): Nay, by Malliwi Rapesheake. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): And what else? 

Man(Eric Idle): 'Two Netlemeg of Verona', 'Twelfth Thing', 'The Chamrent of Venice'.... 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Have you done 'Hamlet'? 

Man(Eric Idle): 'Thamle'.  'Be ot or bot ne ot, tath is the nestquie.' 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): And what is your next project? 

Man(Eric Idle): 'Ring Kichard the Thrid'. 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): I'm sorry? 

Man(Eric Idle): 'A shroe! A shroe! My dingkome for a shroe!' 

Interviewer(Michael Palin): Ah, Ring Kichard, yes...  but surely that's not an anagram, that's a spoonerism. 

Man(Eric Idle): If you're going to split hairs, I'm going to piss off. 

<Direction: he leaves Cut to the naked organist (Terry J), then to the announcer.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): And now... 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's...

<Direction: Pull out a little. The board has little green curtains and there is a pepperpot standing in front of it.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Mrs Scab, you have twelve hours to beat the clock. 

<Direction: A gong rings. A superimposed clock starts to move incredibly fast. It has a minute hand and an hour hand. Twelve hours pass very quickly. The pepperpot starts to rearrange the letters, very quickly. She gets it right. It reads: 'merchant bank'. The gong again and and the clock stops.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Correct! 

Pepperpot(Terry Jones): I've done it. I've done it. Ha, ha, ha! 

<Direction: An enormous head of a large cartoon-type hammer hits her and she goes down very fast. Cut to a city gent in his office. A sign on his desk says a 'Charman Knebter'. He is waiting to answer his phone. It rings; he answers.> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Hello? Ah, Mr Victim, I'm glad to say that I've got the go-ahead to lend you the money you require. Yes, of course we will want as security the deeds of your house, of your aunt's house, of your second cousin's house, of your wife's parents' house, and of your grannie's bungalow, and we will in addition need a controlling interest in your new company, unrestricted access to your private bank account, the deposit in our vaults of your three children as hostages and a full legal indemnity against any acts of embezzlement carried out against you by any members of our staff during the normal course of their duties... no, I'm afraid we couldn't accept your dog instead of your youngest child, we would like to suggest a brand new scheme of ours under which 51% of both your dog and your wife pass to us in the event of your suffering a serious accident. Fine. No, not at all, nice to do business with you. 

<Direction: puts the phone down, speaks on intercom to himself a knock on the door Mr Ford enters, he is collecting for charity with a tin> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Ah, Mr Ford isn't it? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): That's right. 

City Gent(John Cleese): How do you do. I'm a merchant banker. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): How do you do Mr... 

City Gent(John Cleese): Er... I forget my name for the moment but I am a merchant banker. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Oh. I wondered whether you'd like to contribute to the orphan's home. 

<Direction: he rattles the tin> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Well I don't want to show my hand too early, but actually here at Slater Nazi we are quite keen to get into orphans, you know, developing market and all that... what sort of sum did you have in mind? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well... er... you're a rich man. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Yes, I am. Yes. Yes, very very rich. Quite phenomenally wealthy. Yes, I do own the most startling quantifies of cash. Yes, quite right... you're rather a smart young lad aren't you. We could do with somebody like you to feed the pantomime horse. Very smart. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Thank you, sir. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Now, you were saying. I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rich. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): So er, how about a pound? 

City Gent(John Cleese): A pound. Yes, I see. Now this loan would be secured by the... 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): It's not a loan, sir. 

City Gent(John Cleese): What? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): It's not a loan. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Ah. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): You get one of these, sir. 

<Direction: he gives him a flag> 

City Gent(John Cleese): It's a bit small for a share certificate isn't it? Look, I think I'd better run this over to our legal department. If you could possibly pop back on Friday... 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well do you have to do that, couldn't you just give me the pound? 

City Gent(John Cleese): Yes, but you see I don't know what it's for. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): It's for the orphans. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Yes? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): It's a gift. 

City Gent(John Cleese): A what? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): A gift. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Oh a gift! 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Yes. 

City Gent(John Cleese): A tax dodge. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): No, no, no, no. 

City Gent(John Cleese): No? Well, I'm awfully sorry I don't understand. Can you just explain exactly what you want. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well, I want you to give me a pound, and then I go away and give it to the orphans. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well, that's it. 

City Gent(John Cleese): No, no, no, I don't follow this at all, I mean, I don't want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I'm a pound down on the whole deal. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well, yes you are. 

City Gent(John Cleese): I am! Well, what is my incentive to give you the pound? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Well the incentive is - to make the orphans happy. 

<Direction: genuinely puzzled> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Happy?... You quite sure you've got this right? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Yes, lots of people give me money. 

City Gent(John Cleese): What, just like that? 

City Gent(John Cleese): Must be sick. I don't suppose you could give me a list of their names and addresses could you? 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): No, I just go up to them in the street and ask. 

City Gent(John Cleese): Good lord! That's the most exciting new idea I've heard in years! It's so simple it's brilliant! Well, if that idea of yours isn't worth a pound I'd like to know what is. 

<Direction: he takes the tin from Ford> 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Oh, thank you, sir. 

City Gent(John Cleese): The only trouble is, you gave me the idea before I'd given you the pound. And that's not good business. 

Mr Ford(Terry Jones): Isn't it? 

City Gent(John Cleese): No, I'm afraid it isn't. So, um, off you go. 

<Direction: he pulls a lever opening a trap door under Ford's feet and Ford falls through with a yelp> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Nice to do business with you. 

<Direction: Cut briefly to a Mongol.> 

Mongol(Michael Palin): Anyway. 

<Direction: Cut back to the banker.> 

City Gent(John Cleese): And off we go again. 

<Direction: he goes to the intercom> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Ah Miss Godfrey could yould send in the pantomime horses please. 

<Direction: The door opens and two pantomime horses run in. Pantomime music. They do a routine including running round the room and bumping into each other. They then stand in front of the city gent crossing their legs and putting their heads on one side.> 

City Gent(John Cleese): Now I've asked you to ... 

<Direction: they repeat the routine they start again they stop the pantomime horses heads go up, their ears waggle and their eyes go round water spurts out of their eyes in a stream the horses register surprise and generally behave ostentatiously Champion stamps his foot three times Trigger stamps his front foot twice and rear foot once one of the horses runs up to him and puts his head by the city gent's ear> 

City Gent(John Cleese): No, I'm afraid there's no redundancy scheme. 

<Direction: The horses turn and start kicking each other on the shins. After a few blows: German accent one of the pantomime horses turns tail and runs out cut to stock film of sea lions fighting cut to shot of two almost stationary limpets shot of wolf standing still a moving arrow is superimposed the arrow moves to the wolf's throat; the wolf does not move distant shot of two men fighting violently another man joins in shot of honey bear sitting about aimlessly shot of pantomime horse running along in a wood pantomime horse behind tree drops sixteen-ton weight on the horse running under the tree shot of pantomime goose behind a small tree with a bow and arrow we see Terrace walking along the goose fires and hits Terence in the neck; Terrace looks amazed and dies shot of an amazing-looking large woman with a crown waiting in the undergrowth by the side of a path a breakfast tray appears being pulled along the path by a length of wire the pantomime Princess Margaret does so, hurling the harpoon at the moving tray> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Pang! Right in the toast. A brief struggle and all is over. Poor breakfast! Another victim of the.... aargh! 

None(None): ANIMATION:

None(None): CAPTION: 'THE MAKERS OF THIS FILM WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WHO GAVE US LOTS OF MONEY TO SEE THEIR NAMES IN LIGHTS: VICTOR - HIS FRIEND BOBBY - AND - MARY 

<Direction: Pull back to show that 'Mary' is part of a sign saying: 'Mary Recruitment Office'. Pull out to reveal that it is a sign over a shop as for army recruiting office. An RSM with waxed moustache and snappy straight-against-the-forehead peaked cap comes out of the shop. He hangs a clearly printed sign on a nail on the door. It reads: 'Sketch just starting - actor wanted'.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Sketch just starting, actor wanted. 

<Direction: The RSM looks up and down the road, glances up at the sign above his shop without noticing it. He goes inside again. A man walks up, reads the sign and enters. He is Mr Man.> 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Good morning. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Morning, sir. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): I'd like to join the army please. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): I see. Short service or long service commission, sir? 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): As long as possible please. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Right well I'll just take a few particulars and then... 

<Direction: Suddenly he looks as though a dim memory has penetrated his skull. He breaks off, looking thoughtful, walks towards the door and exits. He comes out of shop, looks up at word 'Mary', tuts and changes the letters round to read 'Army'. He suddenly looks round and we see a queue of nuns.> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Shove off! 

<Direction: he goes back inside> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Then there'll be a few forms to sign, and of course we'll need references and then a full medical examination by the ... 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Yes. Yes, yes I see. 

<Direction: diffidently> 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): I was just wondering whether it would be possible for me to join... the women's army? 

RSM(Graham Chapman): The Women's Royal Army Corps, sir? 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was possible for me to have my choice ... I'd prefer to be in the Women's Royal Amy Corps. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here normally go straight into the Scots Guards. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Which is all... men... I suppose? 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Yes it is. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Yes. Are there any regiments which are more effeminate than others? 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines, they're all dead butch. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): You see, what I really wanted was a regiment where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself to work with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Working with fabrics and experimenting with interior design! 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Yes. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then, sir. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Oh. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really doing something new with interior design, with colour, texture, line and that. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): I see. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Oh yes, I mean their use of colour with fabrics is fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day - beautiful, beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black set against aggressive orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is real! 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Really? 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my notice. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): What do you mean? 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Well I mean, when I applied for this job I thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really - I see - I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and you can be a really funny passenger on a bus. 

<Direction: Cut to a bus set. There is a very bad backcloth of the interior of the top deck of a bus. It looks like the set for a rather tatty revue. On the cut Mr Man is standing in exactly the same place as he was - so that it looks as if the scene has changed around him. The RSM appears from one side. He is still dressed basically as an RSM but has a few bus conductor things such as a ticket machine, money satchel and a big arrow through his neck. He talks like a music-hall comedian.> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Any more fares please? I've got a chauffeur and every time I go to the lavatory he drives me potty! Boom-boom! One in a row 

<Direction: sings> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): I'm not unusual. I'm just... 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Fivepenny please. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Five beautiful pennies going in to the bag... and you are the lucky winner of... one fivepenny ticket! 

<Direction: hands him a ticket brief film clip of audience laughing> 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Look! 

RSM(Graham Chapman): I am looking - it's the only way I keep my eyelids apart! Boom-boom! Every one a Maserati! 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): Look! You said I was going to be a funny passenger. 

<Direction: snapping out of music-hall manner> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): What do you mean? 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): I mean, all I said was, fivepenny please, You can't call that a funny line. 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Well it's the way you said it. 

Mr Man(Eric Idle): No it isn't. Nobody can say 'fivepenny please' and make it funny. 

<Direction: Cut to vox pop of city gent in a busy street.> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Fivepenny please. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of audience rolling about with laughter and clapping. Cut back to vox pop of city gent in street. He looks rather bewildered. He shrugs, turns and as he starts to walk away the camera pulls out. We see the city gent pass two colleagues.> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Morning. 

<Direction: They collapse laughing and roll about on the pavement. The city gent hurries on, and turns into the door of a big office block. Cut to the foyer. A hall porter is standing behind a counter.> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Not so warm today, George. 

<Direction: A shriek of mirth from the porter who collapses behind the counter. The city gent continues walking into the lift. There are two other city gents and one secretary already in the lift. The doors shut. Good morning. Good morning.> 

City Gent's Voice(Terry Jones): Good morning. 

<Direction: Shrieks of laughter. Cut to the doors of the lift on the third floor. Lift doors open and the city gent steps out rather quickly looking embarrassed. Behind him he leaves the three collapsed with mirth on the floor. The lift doors shut and the lift goes down again. Cut to interior of boss's office. A knock on the door. The boss is standing with his back to the door desperately preparing himself to keep a straight face.> 

Boss(Michael Palin): Come in, Mr Horton. 

<Direction: The city gent enters.> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Morning, sir. 

Boss(Michael Palin): Do - do sit down. 

<Direction: he indicates chair, trying not to look at the city gent> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): Thank you, sir. 

<Direction: The boss starts to snigger but suppresses it with feat of self-control.> 

Boss(Michael Palin): Now then Horton, you've been with us for twenty years, and your work in the accounts department has been immaculate 

<Direction: the city gent starts to speak; the boss suppresses another burst of laughter almost starts laughing> 

Boss(Michael Palin): ... has undermined the competence of this firm to such a point that I'm afraid that I've got no option but to sack you. 

<Direction: in a broken voice the boss giggles, gets up hastily and turning his back on city gent leans against the mantelpiece; his desire to laugh mounts through the next speech> 

City Gent(Terry Jones): It couldn't have come at a worse time. There's school fees for the two boys coming up, and the wife's treatment costing more now ... I don't know where the money's coming from as it is. And now I don't see any future ... I'd been hoping I'd be able to hang on here just for the last couple of years but... now ... I just want to go out and end it all. 

<Direction: The boss cannot control himself any longer. He collapses in helpless mirth, falling all over the room. Immediately we cut to stock film of terrific audience laughter. Cut to backdrop of a circus ring. In front of it, as if in the ring, stand the RSM and Mr Man. Mr Man is as before. The RSM is dressed the same except that over his uniform he wears baggy trousers and braces and a funny nose. He is responding to the audience applause. Mr Man has obviously just been drenched with hot water - he is soaked and steam is rising.> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you and now for the fish - the fish down the trousers. 

<Direction: the RSM picks up fish and puts it down Mr Man's trousers the RSM pours a bucket of whitewash over him more laughter, the RSM puts custard pie in his face and knees him in the balls> 

RSM(Graham Chapman): It's not my mush - it's your mush. It's your laugh - it's your laugh mate - not mine. It's your bleeding laugh. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of Mr Heath laughing followed by stock film of Women's Institute applauding.>

Mr Orbiter(Michael Palin): Good evening. Well tonight, we are going to talk about... well that is... I am going to talk about... well actually I am talking about it now... well I'm not talking about it now, but I am talking... I know I'm pausing occasionally, and not talking during the pauses, but the pauses are part of the whole process of talking... when one talks one has to pause... er ... like then! I paused ... but I was still talking ... and again there! No the real point of what I'm saying is that when I appear not to be talking don't go nipping out to the kitchen, putting the kettle on ... buttering scones... or getting crumbs and bits of food out of those round brown straw mats that the teapot goes on... because in all probability I'm still talking and what you heard was a pause ... er ... like there again. Look! To make it absolutely easier, so there's no problem at all, what I'll do, I'll give you some kind of sign, like this

Mr Orbiter(Michael Palin): All right? 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE END' 

Mr Orbiter(Michael Palin): No, no! No sorry - just demonstrating... haven't finished. Haven't started yet.

Mr Orbiter(Michael Palin): Tonight I want to talk about... 

<Direction: Cut to the BBC world symbol. voice over> 

Adrian(Eric Idle): We interrupt this programme to annoy you and make things generally irritating for you. 

<Direction: Cut back to Mr Orbiter-5.> 

Mr Orbiter(Michael Palin): ... with a large piece of wet paper. 

<Direction: Cut to the BBC world symbol again and hold throughout the following dialogue. voice over> 

Adrian(Eric Idle): Good evening, we interrupt this programme again, a) to irritate you and, b) to provide work for one of our announcers. 

<Direction: voice over> 

Jack(John Cleese): Good evening, I'm the announcer who's just been given this job by the BBC and I'd just like to say how grateful I am to the BBC for providing me with work, particularly at this time of year, when things are a bit thin for us announcers... um... I don't know whether I should tell you this, but, well, I have been going through a rather tough time recently. Things have been pretty awful at home. My wife, Josephine... 'Joe-jums' as I call her ... who is also an announcer... 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): Hello. 

Jack(John Cleese): ... has not been able to announce since our youngest, Clifford, was born, and, well, 

<Direction: tearfully he starts to sob> 

Dick(Michael Palin): Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick. Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this announcement, so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he, Joe-jums? 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): Pretty bad, Dick. 

Dick(Michael Palin): Jack... it's Dick... Do you want me to make the announcement? 

Jack(John Cleese): No, no Dick. I must do it myself... 

<Direction: emotionally> 

Jack(John Cleese): it's my last chance with the BBC, I can't throw it away... I've got to do it ... for Joe-jums... for the kids... I've got to go through with it... 

Dick(Michael Palin): Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: deep breaths, and try not to think about what you're saying... 

Jack(John Cleese): Good evening. This 

<Direction: a trace of superhuman effort in his voice> 

Jack(John Cleese): is BBC 1... 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): Good luck, Jack. 

Dick(Michael Palin): Keep going, old boy. 

Jack(John Cleese): It's... nine o'clock... and... time... for... the News... read by... Richard Baker. 

<Direction: Cut to start of the 'Nine O'Clock News '.> 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): You've done it. 

Dick(Michael Palin): Congratulations, old man! 

<Direction: Richard Baker is sitting at a desk. As Richard Baker speaks we hear no sounds apart from the sounds of celebration of the announcers - champagne corks popping, etc. At the beginning of the news Baker uses the gesture between sentences that we have seen Mr Orbiter use, plus other gestures. Behind him on the screen a collage of photos appear one after the other: Richard Nixon, Tony Armstrong-Jones, the White House, Princess Margaret, parliament, naked breasts, a scrubbing brush, a man with a stoat through his head, Margaret Thatcher, a lavatory, a Scotsman lying on his back with his knees drawn up, a corkscrew, Edward Heath, a pair of false teeth in a glass. Whilst these have been going on Baker has been making gestures starting with elbow-up gesture and getting progressively more obscure and intriguing. We don't hear him at all, we hear all the announcers having a party and congratulating Jack.> 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): Fantastic darling, you were brilliant. No, no, it was the best you ever did. 

Jack(John Cleese): Thank God. 

Joe-jums(Carol Cleveland): It was absolutely super. 

Dick(Michael Palin): ... have a drink. For God's sake drink this... 

Jack(John Cleese): Fantastic. 

Dick(Michael Palin): The least I could do - super - I must come over. 

Jack(John Cleese): I can't tell you how much that means. 

<Direction: etc. Eventually the voices stop and for the first time we hear Richard Baker's voice.> 

Baker(None): ... until the name Maudling is almost totally obscured. That is the ned of the nicro-not wens. And now it's time for the late night film.

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Oh pantomime horse, that was wonderful. 

Dobbin(None): Would you like another glass? 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): No, no, I mustn't. It makes me throw up... oh, I'm so bleeding happy. 

Dobbin(None): Oh, Simone! 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Oh, pantomime horse.

Loony(Graham Chapman): Then... 

<Direction: The pantomime horse spins round and fires his revolver towards some trees overhanging the water. Another pantomime horse falls out of the tree into the water. A third pantomime horse scurries out from behind a bush and runs off into the undergrowth. Dobbin leaps out of the boat. The girl jumps after him. A car drives out of some bushes on to the road and accelerates away. The pantomime horse is in it. Dobbin and the girl leap into their own expensive sports car and give chase. Shots of exciting chase. After two or three shots of the cars chasing, the two pantomime horses are seen on two tandems, continuing the chase. Cut to them chasing each other on horseback. Cut to them chasing each other on rickshaws. Cut to them chasing each other on foot.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): And now the English pantomime horse has very nearly caught up with the Russian pantomime horse, I think he's going to take him any moment now but what is this? What is this? 

<Direction: round the corner are waiting a pantomime goose and a pantomime Princess Margaret; the Russian pantomime horse runs past them and they leap on the English pantomime horse and a fight starts a car draws up and Terence Rattigan and the Duke of Kent and the RSM run up and join in the fighting; the Russians are joined by Heinz Sielmann and Peter Scott and Jacques Cousteau>

Voice Over(John Cleese): Here you see some English comic actors engaged in a life or death struggle with a rather weak ending. This is typical of the zany madcap world of the irresistible kooky funsters. The English pantomime horse wins and so is assured of a place in British history and a steady job in a merchant bank. Unfortunately, before his pension rights are assured, he catches bronchitis and dies, another victim of the need to finish these shows on time.

And right now it's time to meet your host for tonight Arthur Mee! 

<Direction: Showbiz music, applause, and Arthur Mee appears from the back of the stage; he wears the now traditional spangly jacket. He comes forward and speaks into the mike (the sound is rather hollow and strident as in big halls with a hastily rigged PA).> 

Mee(Terry Jones): Good evening and welcome, whereas Proust would say, 'la malade imaginaire de recondition et de toute surveillance est bientÃ´t la mÃªme chose'. 

<Direction: roars of applause; quick shot of grinning faces of the jury curtain pulls back at back of stage to reveal a true, enormous, but cheap, audience appreciation gauge; it lists the seven books of Proust's masterwork in the form of a thermometer Harry Bagot, in evening dress, comes forward from back of stage, he has a number three on his back; Mee leads the applause for him now> 

Mee(Terry Jones): . 

<Direction: Music starts, continuity-type music. The needle of the Proustometer creeps up almost inperceptibly to a tiny level.> 

Harry(Graham Chapman): Proust's novel ostensibly tells of the irrevocability of time lost, the forfeiture of innocence through experience, the reinstallment of extra-temporal values of time regained, ultimately the novel is both optimistic and set within the context of a humane religious experience, re-stating as it does the concept of intemporality. In the first volume, Swarm, the family friend visits... 

<Direction: Gong goes, chord of music, applause. The meter has hardly risen at all.> 

Mee(Terry Jones): Well tried, Harry. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): A good attempt there but unfortunately he chose a general appraisal of the work, before getting on to the story and as you can see 

<Direction: close up of Proustometer> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): he only got as far as page one of 'Swarm's Way', the first of the seven volumes. A good try though and very nice posture. 

<Direction: Cut back to the stage.> 

Mee(Terry Jones): Harry Bagot, you're from Luton? 

Harry(Graham Chapman): Yes, Arthur, yeah. 

Mee(Terry Jones): Now Harry what made you first want to try and start summarizing Proust? 

Harry(Graham Chapman): Well I first entered a seaside Summarizing Proust Competition when I was on holiday in Bournemouth, and my doctor encouraged me with it. 

Mee(Terry Jones): And Harry, what are your hobbies outside summarizing? 

Harry(Graham Chapman): Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating. 

Mee(Terry Jones): Well, thank you Harry Bagot. 

<Direction: Harry walks off-stage. Music and applause.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Well there he goes. Harry Bagot. He must have let himself down a bit on the hobbies, golf's not very popular around here, but never mind, a good try. 

Mee(Terry Jones): Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Mr Rutherford from Leicester, are you ready Ronald? 

<Direction: Ronald is a very eager man in tails> 

Mee(Terry Jones): Right. On the summarizing spot. You have got fifteen seconds from now. 

Ronald(Michael Palin): Er, well, Swann, Swann, there's this house, there's this house, and er, it's in the morning, it's in the morning - no, it's the evening, in the evening and er, there's a garden and er, this bloke comes in - bloke comes in - what's his name - what's his name, er just said it - big bloke - Swann, Swann 

<Direction: The gong sounds. Mee pushes Ronald out.> 

Mee(Terry Jones): And now ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome the last of our all-England finalists this evening, from Bingley, the Bolton Choral Society and their leader Superintendent McGough, 

<Direction: a big choir comes on, immaculately drilled, each holding a score, with Fred Tomlinson as superintendent McGough> 

Mee(Terry Jones): All right Bingley, remember you've got fifteen seconds to summarize Proust in his entirety starting from now. 

First Soloist(None): Proust, in his first book wrote about... fa la la... 

Second Soloist(None): Proust in his first book wrote about... 

Tenors(None): He wrote about... 

<Direction: They continue contrapuntally, in madrigal, never getting beyond these words until they rallentando to say... Proust in his first book wrote about the... gong sounds> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Very ambitious try there, but in fact the least successful of the evening, they didn't even get as far as the first volume. 

<Direction: the singers leave the stage> 

Mee(Terry Jones): Well ladies and gentlemen, I don't think any of our contestants this evening have succeeded in encapsulating the intricacies of Proust's masterwork, so I'm going to award the first prize this evening to the girl with the biggest tits. 

<Direction: Applause and music. A lady with enormous knockers comes on to the side of the stage. Roll credits: THE ALL-ENGLAND SUMMARIZE PROUST COMPETITION A BBC PRODUCTION WITH MR I. T. BRIDDOCK, 2379, THE TERRACE, HODDESDON. IT WAS CONCEIVED, WRITTEN AND PERFORMED BY... Roll usual Monty Python credits and music. Behind them the lady accepts the cup and the singers come back on stage and admire her. Fade out. Slight pause. Fade up on stock film of Everest. Whistling wind, stirring music.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. The mountain with the biggest tits in the world. 

<Direction: Sound of gong.> 

Second Voice Over(Eric Idle): Start again! 

<Direction: A very silly loony leans into shot, on overlay (i.e. in front of the picture), and waves to the camera. He goes out of shot again.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. This year, this remote Himalayan mountain, this mystical temple, surrounded by the most difficult terrain in the world, repulsed yet another attempt to conquer it. This time, by the International Hairdresser's Expedition. 

<Direction: cut to shot of pup tent in blizzard> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): In such freezing, adverse conditions, man comes very close to breaking point. What was the real cause of the disharmony which destroyed their chances at success? 

<Direction: Cut to three head-and-shoulders shots. They look like typical mountaineers: frost in their beards, tanned, with snow glasses on their foreheads and authentic Everest headgear.> 

First Climber(Michael Palin): Well, people would keep taking my hairdryer and never returning it. 

Second Climber(Graham Chapman): There was a lot of bitching in the tents. 

Third Climber(Eric Idle): You couldn't get near the mirror. 

<Direction: Cut to a colonel figure, digging in a garden in Jersey.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir John 'Teasy-Weasy' Butler, veteran of K2, Annapurna, and Vidals. His plan was to ignore the usual route around the South Col and to make straight for the top. 

<Direction: Cut to a photo of Everest with dots superimposed, showing the route.> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): We established base salon here, 

<Direction: on the photos, we see the words 'base salon' at the top of the route we see 'Mario's'> 

Colonel(Graham Chapman): From here using crampons and cutting ice steps as we went, we moved steadily up the Lhotse Face to the North Ridge, establishing camp three where we could get a hot meal, a manicure, and a shampoo and set. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of people actually climbing Everest.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Could it work? Could this eighteen-year old hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon storms. Patrice takes up the story. 

<Direction: Cut to interior of hairdresser's salon. Patrice speaks into the mirror, as he is blow-drying and curling a lady's hair.> 

Patrice(Eric Idle): Well, we knew as well as anyone that the monsoons were due, but the thing was, Ricky and I had just had a blow dry and rinse, and we couldn't go out for a couple of days. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of some people leaving a little tent on a mountain.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): After a blazing row, the Germans and Italians had turned back, taking with them the last of the hair nets. On the third day a blizzard blew up. 

<Direction: close up on the tent in a blizzard; no people in shot> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Temperatures fell to minus thirty centigrade. Inside the little tent, things were getting desperate. 

<Direction: We cut inside the tent. The wind is banging against the side of the material, sounds of a vicious blizzard. Ricky is sitting next to another member of the expedition. Both are under hairdryers, in full climbing gear up to their necks. One is reading Vogue. Ricky is doing his nails.> 

Ricky(Michael Palin): Well, things have got so bad that we've been forced to use the last of the heavy oxygen equipment just to keep the dryers going. 

<Direction: off-screen Cup of Milo, love.> 

Ricky(Michael Palin): Oh, she's a treas. 

<Direction: he takes the drink Cut to a wide shot of Everest.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But a new factor had entered the race. A team of French chiropodists, working with brand new cornplasters and Doctor Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals, were covering ground fast. The Glasgow Orpheus Male Voice Choir were tackling the difficult North Col. 

<Direction: quick cut to film of lots of people climbing up Everest; dubbed over is the 'Proust' song as in 'Proust Competition' item cut to a diagram with hundreds of dotted lines over it, fourteen different routes> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): were at his heels. This was it. Ricky had to make a decision. 

<Direction: Cut back to Patrice in the salon.> 

Patrice(Eric Idle): Well, he decided to open a salon. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): It was a tremendous success. 

<Direction: Cinema-style adverts with still photos.> 

Advert Voice(Eric Idle): Challenging Everest? Why not drop in at Ricky Pules' - only 24,000 feet from this cinema. Ricky and Maurice offer a variety of styles for the well-groomed climber. Like Sherpa Tensing and Sir Edmond Hillary be number one on top, when you're Number One on Top? 

<Direction: just their heads turn to show off the hair-do Animated sketch leads to little old Mrs Little on the phone in her hall. She is a dear little old lady and lives in a rather fussy ducks-on-wall house.> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Hello, is that the fire brigade? 

<Direction: Cut to the fire station.> 

First Fireman(Michael Palin): No, sorry, wrong number. 

<Direction: He puts the phone back. Pull out to reveal four or five firemen in full gear, surrounded by fire-fighting equipment and a gleaming fire engine. The firemen are engaged in a variety of homely pursuits: one is soldering a crystal set, another is cooking at a workbench, another is doing embroidery, another is at a sewing machine. The first fireman is at the phone on the wall. He goes back to clearing up a budgie's cage.> 

Second Fireman(Eric Idle): That phone's not stopped ringing all day. 

Third Fireman(None): What happens when you've mixed the batter, do you dice the ham with the coriander? 

First Fireman(Michael Palin): No, no, you put them in separately when the vine leaves are ready. 

<Direction: The phone rings.> 

Second Fireman(Eric Idle): Oh, no, not again. 

Third Fireman(None): Take it off the hook. 

<Direction: The first fireman takes the phone off the hook. Cut back to Mrs Little on phone. She looks at the receiver then listens again.> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn. 

<Direction: Mervyn, her 38-year-old, 6' 8" son appears.> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh it doesn't do any good, dear. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or not? 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Yes I do, Mervyn. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Well go and play the cello! 

<Direction: She looks helplessly at him, then goes into the sitting room. Mervyn dials.> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Hello, hello, operator? Yes we're trying to get the fire brigade ... No, the fire brigade. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what? ... 

<Direction: he takes one of his shoes off and looks in it> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Size eight. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no of course not, Yes... 

<Direction: Mrs Little appears, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. touching Mervyn gently on the arm> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): He's gone, dear. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): What? 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): He's slipped away. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): The sodding hamster's dead! 

<Direction: broken> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Oh no!! What were you playing? 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Some Mozart concertos, dear. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): What... How did he... ? 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): His eyes just closed, and he fell into the wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie George Football Book'. 

<Direction: handing her the phone> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Right, you hang on. I must go and see him. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still have gone. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it. 

<Direction: restraining him> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): There isn't an upstairs dear, it's a bungalow. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Damn. 

<Direction: he storms off into the phone she takes her shoe off and looks inside> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): size three, yes it's just - we've lost a dear one and my son was ... yes, that's right, size eight, yes and... Oh I see... yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I see, yes, yes, I, I ... Yes, yes. No ... no... yes, I see. They can't get the fire brigade Mervyn - will the Boys' Brigade do? 

<Direction: off> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): No! They'd be useless! 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment, thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes, ... no, Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye. 

<Direction: As she puts the phone down the front door beside her opens and there stands a huge African warrior in war paint and with a spear and shield. At his feet are several smart suitcases.> 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Mummy! 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Eamonn. 

<Direction: he brings in the cases and closes the front door> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Mervyn! Look it's our Eamonn - oh let me look at you, tell me how... how is it in Dublin? 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Well, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh don't talk. Let me just look at you. 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Great to be home, mummy. How are you? 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh, I'm fine. I must just go upstairs and get your room ready. 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): It's a bungalow, mummy. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh damn, yes. Mervyn, Mervyn - look who's here, it's our Eamonn come back to see us. 

<Direction: Mervyn appears. He still looks shattered by the death of the hamster.> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Hello, Eamonn. 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Hello, Merv. 

Mervyn(John Cleese): How was Dublin? 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Well as I was telling mummy here, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement. 

<Direction: The phone rings. answering phone looking at Eamonn's bare foot> 

Mervyn(John Cleese): Size seven. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes .... it's the fire brigade, they want to know if they can come round Thursday evening. 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh no, Thursday's the Industrial Relations Bill Dinner Dance. Can't they make it another day? 

<Direction: into the phone fade out Fade up on a dinner-jacketed announcer sitting at a table with a bowl of flowers on it. A hand waves from inside the bowl of flowers.> 

Announcer(Michael Palin): And so it was the fire brigade eventually came round on Friday night. 

<Direction: Cut to fire engines skidding out of the fire station and roaring away - speeded up. They skid to a halt outside the Littles' suburban house. Firemen pour out of the fire engine and start to swarm in through the windows. Cut to interior of Littles' sitting room. It is laid out for a cocktail party. Mervyn is in evening dress and is sitting on the sofa looking very depressed. Mrs Little in a faded cocktail dress. Eamonn still in warpaint with spear and shield. The firemen appear.> 

Mrs Little(Terry Jones): Oh, so glad you could come. What would you like to drink? Gin and tonic? Sherry? 

<Direction: in unison as she starts to pour drinks the firemen confide in unison We do like being called out to these little parties, they're much better than fires. The phone rings. Half the firemen go to answer it. off Yes, yes yes. Well, how was Dublin, Eamonn?> 

Eamonn(Graham Chapman): Well, as I was telling mummy and Mervyn earlier, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional...

<Direction: Cut to Veronica in the 'Party Hints' set - a chintzy kitchen.> 

Veronica(Eric Idle): Hello, Last week on 'Party Hints' I showed you how to make a small plate of goulash go round twenty-six people, how to get the best out of your canapÃ©s, and how to unblock your loo. This week I'm going to tell you what to do if there is an armed communist uprising near your home when you're having a party. Well obviously it'll depend how far you've got 

Veronica(None): with 

Veronica(Eric Idle): your party when the signal for Red Revolt is raised. If you're just having preliminary aperitifs - Dubonnet, a sherry or a sparkling white wine - then the guests will obviously be in a fairly formal mood and it will be difficult to tell which are the communist agitators. So the thing to do is to get some cloth and some bits of old paper, put it down on the floor and shoot everybody. This will deal with the Red Menace on your own doorstep. If you're having canapÃ©s, as I showed you last week, or an outdoor barbecue, then the thing to do is to set fire to all houses in the street. This will stir up anti-communist hatred and your neighbours will be right with you as you organize counter-revolutionary terror. So you see, if you act promptly enough, any left-wing uprising can be dealt with by the end of the party. Bye... 

None(None): ANIMATION:

Second Booth(Terry Jones): I'm afraid I cannot comment on that until it's been officially hushed up. 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): This is our politicians booth. 

Second Booth(Terry Jones): While there is no undue cause for concern, there is certainly no room for complacency. Ha, ha, ha. He, he, he. 

<Direction: They pass on to the next booth.>

Tick(John Cleese): Superb. 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): Well then what sort of thing were you looking for? 

Tick(John Cleese): Well, er, really something to make me a little less insignificant? 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): Oh, I see sort of 'Now look here, you may be Chairman but your bloody pusillanimous behaviour makes me vomit!' That sort of thing?... 

Tick(John Cleese): Oh no, no, no, not really no. 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): Oh I see, well perhaps something a bit more sort of Clive Jenkins-ish? Perhaps - sort of

Tick(John Cleese): Oh no, I really want something that will make people be attracted to me like a magnet. 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): I see, well, you want our 'Life and Soul of the Party' tape then, I think. 

Tick(John Cleese): What's that? 

Mr Mann(Graham Chapman): Well it's sort of 'Ello squire, haven't seen you for a bit, haven't seen you for a bit either, Beryl. Two pints of wallop please, love. Still driving the Jensen then? Cheer up Jack it may never happen, what's your poison then?' 

Tick(John Cleese): Fantastic, yes.

<Direction: By the time Bounder is saying his last sentence the camera has revealed the office and Bounder himself sitting at a desk. Bounder now replaces the telephone into which he has been speaking. After a pause the tourist - Mr Smoke-Too-Much - enters the office and approaches Mr Bounder's secretary.> 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Good morning. 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Oh good morning. 

<Direction: sexily> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Do you want to go upstairs? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): What? 

<Direction: brightly> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Or have you come to arrange a holiday? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Er.......to arrange a holiday. 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Oh sorry. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): What's all this about going upstairs? 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Oh, nothing, nothing. Now where were you thinking of going? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): India. 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Ah one of our adventure holidays! 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Yes! 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Well you'd better see Mr Bounder about that. Mr Bounder, this gentleman is interested in the India Overland. 

<Direction: Walks over to Bounder's desk where he is greeted by Bounder.> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Ah good morning. I'm Bounder of Adventure. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): My name is Smoke-Too-Much. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): What? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): My name is Smoke-Too-Much. Mr Smoke-Too-Much. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Well you'd better cut down a little then. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): You'd better cut down a little then. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Oh I see! Cut down a bit, for Smoke-Too-Much. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Yes, he he...I expect you get people making jokes about your name all the time, eh? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): No, no actually. Actually, it never struck me before. Smoke...too...much! 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Anyway, you're interested in one of our adventure holidays, eh? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Yes. I saw your advert in the bolour supplement. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): The what? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): The bolour supplement. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): The colour supplement? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Yes. I'm sorry I can't say the letter 'B'. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): C? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Yes that's right. It's all due to a trauma I suffered when I was a sboolboy. I was attacked by a bat. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): A cat? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): No a bat. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Can you say the letter 'K'? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Oh yes, Khaki, king, kettle, Kuwait, Keble Bollege Oxford. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Why don't you say the letter 'K' instead of the letter 'C'? 

Tourist(Eric Idle): What you mean.....spell bolour with a K? 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Kolour. Oh that's very good, I never thought of that. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Anyway, about the holiday.. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Well I saw your adverts in the paper and I've been on package tours several times, you see, and I decided that this was for me. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Ah good. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): Yes I quite agree with you, I mean what's the point of being treated like a sheep, I mean I'm fed up with going abroad and being treated like a sheep, what's the point of being carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty mindless oafs from Kettering and Boventry in their cloth caps and their cardigans and their transistor radios and their 'Sunday Mirrors', complaining about the tea, 'Oh they don't make it properly here do they not like at home' stopping at Majorcan bodegas, selling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and calamares and two veg and sitting in cotton sun frocks squirting Timothy White's suncream all over their puffy raw swollen purulent flesh cos they 'overdid it on the first day'! 

<Direction: agreeing patiently> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Yes. Absolutely, yes, I quite agree... 

Tourist(Eric Idle): And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and Bellvueses and Bontinentals with their international luxury modern roomettes and their Watney's Red Barrel and their swimming pools full of fat German businessmen pretending they're acrobats and forming pyramids and frightening the children and barging in to the queues and if you're not at your table spot on seven you miss your bowl of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, the first item on the menu of International Cuisine, and every Thursday night there's a bloody cabaret in the bar featuring some tiny emaciated dago with nine-inch hips and some big fat bloated tart with her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting Flamenco for Foreigners. 

<Direction: beginning to get fed up> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, now... 

Tourist(Eric Idle): And then some adenoidal typists from Birmingham with diarrhoea and flabby white legs and hairy bandy-legged wop waiters called Manuel, and then, once a week there's an excursion to the local Roman ruins where you can buy cherryade and melted ice cream and bleedin' Watney's Red Barrel, and one night they take you to a local restaurant with local colour and colouring and they show you there and you sit next to a party of people from Rhyl who keeps singing 'Torremolinos, Torremolinos' and complaining about the food - 'Oh! It's so greasy isn't it?' and then you get cornered by some drunken greengrocer from Luton with an Instamatic and Dr Scholl sandals and last Tuesday's 'Daily Express' and he drones on and on and on about how Mr. Smith should be running this country and how many languages Enoch Powell can speak and then he throws up all over the Cuba Libres. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Will you be quiet please. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): And sending tinted postcards of places they don't know they haven't even visited, 'to all at number 22, weather wonderful, our room is marked with an "X". Wish you were here.' 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Shut up. 

Tourist(Eric Idle): 'Food very greasy but we have managed to find this marvellous little place hidden away in the back streets.' 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Shut up! 

Tourist(Eric Idle): 'Where you can even get Watney's Red Barrel and cheese and onion...' 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Shut up!!! 

Tourist(Eric Idle): '...crisps and the accordionist plays "Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner"' and spending four days on the tarmac at Luton airport on a five-day package tour with nothing to eat but dried Watney's sandwhiches.... 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Shut your bloody gob! I've had enough of this, I'm going to ring the police. 

<Direction: He dials and waits. Cut to a corner of a police station. One policeman is knitting, another is making a palm tree out of old newspapers. The phone rings. Oh...take it off the hook. they do so Cut back to travel agent's office. The man is still going on, the travel agent looks crossly at the phone and puts it down. Then picks it up and dials again.> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Hello operator, operator...I'm trying to get the police...the police yes, what? 

<Direction: takes off his shoe and looks inside> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): nine and a half, nine and a half, yes, yes...I see...well can you keep trying please... 

<Direction: Through all this the tourist is still going on:> 

Tourist(Eric Idle): ...and there's nowhere to sleep and the kids are vomitting and throwing up on the plastic flowers and they keep telling you it'll only be another hour although your plane is still in Iceland waiting to take some Swedes to Yugoslavia before it can pick you up on the tarmac at 3 a.m. in the bloody morning and you sit on the tarmac till six because of 'unforeseen difficulties'. i.e. the permanent strike of Air Traffic Control in Paris, and nobody can go to the lavatory until you take off at eight, and when you get to Malaga airport everybody's swallowing Enterovioform tablets and queuing for the toilets and when you finally get to the hotel, there's no water in the taps, there's no water in the pool, there's no water in the bog and there's a bleeding lizard in the bidet, and half the rooms are double-booked and you can't sleep anyway... 

<Direction: The secretary comes up and looks into the camera.> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting...will you come this way please... 

<Direction: The camera follows her as she leads us out of the office, with agent and client still rabbitting on, down a short passage to a documentary interview set where the two participants are sitting waiting. We follow her into the set.> 

Secretary(Carol Cleveland): Here they are. 

<Direction: she turns to the camera again, which moves a little towards her, as if waiting to be summoned>

Presenter(Graham Chapman): You have a new theory about the brontosaurus. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Can I just say here Chris for one moment that I have a new theory about the brontosaurus. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Exactly. 

<Direction: he gestures but she does not say anything> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): What is it? 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Where? 

<Direction: looks around> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): No, no your new theory? 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Oh, what is my theory? 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Oh what is my theory that it is. Yes, well you may well ask me what is my theory. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): I 

Presenter(None): am 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): asking. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Good for you. My word yes. Well Chris, what is it that it is - this theory of mine. Well, this is what it is - my theory that I have, that is to say, which is mine, is mine. 

<Direction: beginning to show signs of exasperation> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes, I know it's yours, what is it? 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Where? Oh, what is my theory? This is it. 

<Direction: clears throat at some length clears throat at great length> 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): This is how it goes. The next thing I'm going to say is my theory. Ready? 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes! 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): My Theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): That's 

Presenter(None): it 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): , is it? 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Spot on, Chris. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Well, er, this theory of yours seems to have hit the nail on the head. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): And it's mine. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes, thank you for coming along to the studio. Thank you. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): My pleasure, Chris...

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes, thank you. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): And whose it is. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes, thank you - that's all - thank you. ...opens next week. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): I have another theory. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Called my second theory, or my theory number two. 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Thank you. Britain's newest wasp farm... 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): This second theory which was the one that I had said... 

<Direction: the phone rings; he answers> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Yes, no I'm trying... 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Which I could expound without doubt. This second theory which, with the one which I have said, forms the brace of theories which I own and which belongs to me, goes like this... 

<Direction: looking at  his shoe> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): nine and a half, wide fitting...Balleys of Bond Street. What? No, sort of brogue. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): This is what it is.

Presenter(Graham Chapman): Eight and a half. 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): This is it... 

<Direction: lots of noisy throat clearing He rises and leaves the set to go next door to the travel agent set, leaving Miss Elk behind for a moment. Bounder is still on the phone. His other phone rings; he answers it.> 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Hello, yes,,,yes,,, 

<Direction: The presenter enters the travel set. The tourist is still droning on as before and Bounder is still on the phone. carrying on all through the scene below> 

Tourist(Eric Idle): ...and the Spanish Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the last outbreak of Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe, and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting sixteen-year-olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone under nineteen who doesn't like Franco... 

<Direction: The presenter approaches Bounder.> 

Presenter(Graham Chapman): The fire brigade are here. They're coming. 

Bounder(Michael Palin): Hello! No, no, no I think they are all part of the British Shoe Corporation now. 

<Direction: Miss Elk follows the presenter in.> 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): Chris, this other theory of mine which is mine like the other one I also own. The second theory... 

<Direction: The fire brigade enter and the secretary goes to greet them. They speak to her and she takes off her shoe to check the size. Meanwhile...> 

Miss Elk(John Cleese): My second theory states that fire brigade choirs seldom sing songs about Marcel Proust. 

<Direction: With only a half-beat pause the fire brigade start singing the Proust song. After the usual number of lines we hear the gong.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Start again. 

<Direction: The loony looks into the scene on overlay and waves at the camera just as we fade to black. We hold black for a few seconds and then the loony leans in to the black and waves again before fading away. Newsreel footage. newsreel voice Red Devils flying; picture of Edward Heath coach load of pepperpots, middle class, grey hair, Mary Whitehouse glasses; the coach says 'Tory Tours' cut to a factory yard; some workers in brown overalls are eating sandwiches out of tins; the clock says 1:15; the coach comes swinging in in undercrank, the ladies pour out about to belt the men with umbrellas and handbags; the men flee back into factories a man at a machine, producing something incredibly fast; a pepperpot holds an enormous sledgehammer wide shot of factory interior; three pepperpots stand on a gantry above work floor, wearing armbands, saying 'P.P.' and dark Mary Whitehouse glasses a group of strikers, picketing with slogans, 'Fair Pay', 'Less Profits', 'Parity', 'No Victimization' pepperpots arrive, clinging to side of old Buick; they race in and start beating the strikers with the banners art gallery exterior; pepperpots run in with bundles and ladders cut to art gallery interior, pan around paintings 'cleaned up'- trousers and cardigans being added to nude pictures and statues, Bermuda shorts on David, shorts on tubular structure, an attendant in shorts too> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): . And it's not just the modern so-called plastic arts that get the clean-up treatment. 

<Direction: Cut to a theatre stage. Desdemona on a bed. Othello with her. Oh Desdemona, Desdemona. The pepperpots race on to the stage and pull him off.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And those continentals had better watch out for their dirty foreign literature. Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Genet won't know what's hit them. Never mind the foulness of their language - come '73 they'll all have to write in British. 

<Direction: pepperpots burning books: 'Bertrand Russell', 'Das Kapital', the 'Guardian', 'Sartre', 'Freud'>

<Direction: Cut to the BBC TV Centre. The peppetpots parade in carrying signs: 'Clean TV Centre', 'God Says No To Filth', 'To The Cells'. Another pepperpot in the background holds a sign: 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' and photo of Robert Robinson.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Better watch out for those nasty continental shows on the sneaky second channel. 

<Direction: armed pepperpots escorting people out of TV Centre> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But apart from attacking that prurient hot-bed of left-wing continentalism at Shepherds Bush, what else do these ordinary mums think? Do they accept Hegelianism? 

First Pepperpot(Graham Chapman): No! .. 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Do they prefer Leibnitz to Wittgenstein? 

Second Pepperpot(Terry Jones): No! No! 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And where do they stand on young people? 

Third Pepperpot(Eric Idle): Just here, dear. 

<Direction: pepperpot standing on long-haired youth's head> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): And their power is growing daily and when these girls roll their sleeves up its arms all the way. 

<Direction: pepperpots standing on the turret of an armoured vehicle; four pepperpots on motor bikes flank it> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): Yes, this is the way to fight the constant war against pornography. 

<Direction: Machine guns chatter. Two pepperpots in a trench firing. Mortar bombs, reloading and firing. Bombs and smoke. At the end of the film we pick up on the nude organist (Terry J), sitting amongst the explosions. He plays his chords.>

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

<Direction: Animated titles.> 

Voice(John Cleese): Monty Python's Flying Circus. 

<Direction: Close up on a sign saying 'Harley Street'. Stirring music. Mix through to interior of a smart, plush, ever so expensive Harley Street consulting room. The music swells and fades. Knocking at door, a short pause, then T.F. Gumby enters, backwards.> 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR! 

<Direction: he goes up to the antique desk and bangs the bell violently; he smashes the intercom and generally breaks the desk up> 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR! DOCTOR! Doctor! Doctor! Where is the Doctor? 

<Direction: A pause. Then another door opens and another Gumby appears.> 

Specialist(John Cleese): Hello! 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): Are you the brain specialist? 

Specialist(John Cleese): No, no, I am not the brain specialist. No, no, I am not... Yes. Yes I am. 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): My brain hurts! 

Specialist(John Cleese): Well let's take a look at it, Mr Gumby. 

<Direction: Gumby specialist starts to pull up Gumby's sweater.> 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): No, no, no, my brain in my head. 

<Direction: specialist thumps him on the head> 

Specialist(John Cleese): It will have to come out. 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): Out? Of my head? 

Specialist(John Cleese): Yes! All the bits of it. Nurse! Nurse! 

<Direction: a nurse enters> 

Specialist(John Cleese): NURSE! NURSE! Nurse, take Mr Gumby to a brain surgeon. 

Nurse(None): Yes doctor... 

<Direction: She leads Gumby out. In the background the specialist is grunting and shouting.> 

Specialist(John Cleese): Where's the 'Lancet'? 

<Direction: to T. F. Gumby He's brilliant you know.> 

Specialist(John Cleese): Where's the bloody 'Lancet'? My brain hurts too. 

<Direction: Ambulance racing. 'Dr Kildare' theme. Cut to operating theatre. The surgeon is not a Gumby. putting on Gumby props Gumby voice> 

Surgeon(Graham Chapman): I'm going to operate!! 

<Direction: We now see he is surrounded by Gumbys. T. F. Gumby is on operating table. Let's operate. They begin to use woodworking implements on T. F. Gumby.> 

T. F. Gumby(Michael Palin): Hello! 

Surgeon(Graham Chapman): Ooh! We forgot the anaesthetic! 

Operating Gumbys(None): The anaesthetic! The anaesthetic! 

<Direction: At that moment a Gumby anaesthetist comes crashing through the wall with two gas cylinders.> 

Gumby Anaesthetist(Terry Jones): I've come to anaesthetize you!! 

<Direction: He raises a gas cylinder and strikes Gumby hard over the head with it. Bong. Blackness. Into the oblivion of animation. Then cut to an ordinary suburban living room. Mr and Mrs Jalin are sitting on a sofa. The previous item in the show is visible on their TV set. Mrs Jalin is stuffing a chicken. Mr Jalin is reading the telephone directory. The picture changes and we hear voice from TV.> 

Voice(Eric Idle): The 'Nine O'Clock News' which was to follow has been cancelled tonight so we can bring you the quarter finals of the All Essex Badminton Championship. Your commentator as usual is Edna O'Brien. 

<Direction: Irish accent> 

Commentator(Michael Palin): Hullo fans. Begorra an' to be sure there's some fine badminton down there in Essex this afternoon. We really... 

<Direction: Mr Jalin picks up a jousting ball and chain and smashes the TV set. There is a ring from the doorbell. Mr Jalin sits, Mrs Jalin goes to the door, exits and comes back.> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): George. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Yes, Gladys. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): There's a man at the door with a moustache. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Tell him I've already got one. 

<Direction: Mrs Jalin hits him hard with a newspaper> 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): All right, all right. What's he want then? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): He says do we want a documentary on molluscs. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Molluscs?! 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): What's he mean, molluscs? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): MOLLUSCS!! GASTROPODS! LAMELLIBRANCHS! CEPHALOPODS! 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Oh molluscs, I thought you said bacon. 

<Direction: she hits him again> 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): All right, all right. What's he charge then? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): It's free. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Ooh! Where does he want us to sit? 

<Direction: calling through the door> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): He says yes. 

<Direction: Mr Zorba enters carrying plywood flat with portion cut out to represent TV. He stands behind flat and starts.> 

Zorba(John Cleese): Good evening. Tonight molluscs. The mollusc is a soft-bodied, unsegmented invertebrate animal usually protected by a large shell. One of the most numerous groups of invertebrates, it is exceeded in number of species only by the arthropods ... viz. 

<Direction: he holds up a lobster> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Not very interesting is it? 

Zorba(John Cleese): What? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): I was talking to him. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Oh. Anyway, the typical mollusc, viz, a snail 

<Direction: holds one up> 

Zorba(John Cleese): consists of a prominent muscular portion... the head-foot... a visceral mass and a shell which is secreted by the free edge of the mantle. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Dreadful isn't it? 

Zorba(John Cleese): Oh. Well anyway... in some molluscs, however, viz, slugs, 

Zorba(John Cleese): the shell is absent or rudimentary... 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Switch him off. 

<Direction: Mrs Jalin gets up and looks for the switch unsuccessfully.> 

Zorba(John Cleese): Whereas in others, viz, cephalopods the head-foot is greatly modified and forms tentacles, viz, the squid. 

<Direction: looking out> 

Zorba(John Cleese): What are you doing? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Switching you off. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Why, don't you like it? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Oh it's dreadful. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Embarrassing. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Is it? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Yes, it's perfectly awful. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the nerve to put it on. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): It's so boring. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Well ... it's not much of a subject is it... be fair. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): What do you think, George? 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Give him another twenty seconds. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Anyway the majority of the molluscs are included in three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the cephalopods... 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): We knew that 

<Direction: she gets up and goes to the set> 

Zorba(John Cleese): However, what is more interesting, er ... is the molluscs's er ... sex life. 

<Direction: stopping dead> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Oh! 

Zorba(John Cleese): Yes, the mollusc is a randy little fellow whose primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know what. 

<Direction: going back to sofa> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Disgusting! 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): Ought not to be allowed. 

Zorba(John Cleese): The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the rock-face. How am I doing? 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Disgusting. 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): But more interesting. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Oh yes, tch, tch, tch. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral locomotion ... is 

Zorba(None): not 

Zorba(John Cleese): the marrying kind: 'Anywhere anytime' is its motto. Up with the shell and they're at it. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): How about the lamellibranchs? 

Zorba(John Cleese): I'm coming to them ... the great scallop 

<Direction: holds up a clam> 

Zorba(John Cleese): This latter is a right whore, a harlot, a trollop, a cynical bed-hopping firm-breasted Rabelaisian bit of sea food that makes Fanny Hill look like a dead Pope... and finally among the lamellibranch bivalves, that most depraved of the whole sub-species - the whelk. The whelk is nothing but a homosexual of the worst kind. This gay boy of the gastropods, this queer crustacean, this mincing mollusc, this screaming, prancing, limp-wristed queen of the deep makes me sick. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Have you got one? 

Zorba(John Cleese): Here! 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Let's kill it. Disgusting. 

<Direction: Zorba throws it on the floor and Mr and Mrs Jalin stamp on it.> 

Mr Jalin(Terry Jones): That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very interesting programme. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Oh, not at all. Thank you. 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Yes, that was very nice. 

Zorba(John Cleese): Thank you. 

<Direction: he shakes hands with her> 

Mrs Jalin(Graham Chapman): Oh, thank you.

<Direction: photo behind changes to close up of another faceless minister photo changes to exterior of the Home Office photo of the Houses of Parliament the camera starts to track slowly into the newsreader's face so that it is eventually filling the screen> 

Newsreader(Michael Palin): broke down the door to the serving hatch, painted the spare room and next weekend I think they'll be able to make a start on the boy's bedroom, while Amy and Roger, up in London for a few days, go to see the mysterious Mr Grenville. 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'TODAY IN PARLIAMENT HAS NOW BECOME THE CLASSIC SERIAL' 

Newsreader(Michael Palin): He in turn has been revealed by D'Arcy as something less than an honest man. Sybil feels once again a resurgence of her old affection and she and Balreau return to her little house in Clermont-Ferrand, the kind of two-up, two-down house that most French workers throughout the European Community are living in today. 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE CLASSIC SERIAL HAS NOW BECOME THE TUESDAY DOCUMENTARY'

Presenter(Eric Idle): makes cheap housing a reality. The walls of these houses are lined with prestressed asbestos which keeps the house warm and snuggly and ever so safe from the big bad rabbit, who can scratch and scratch for all he's worth, but he just can't get into Porky's house.

Presenter(Eric Idle): and nobody saw the big bad rabbit ever again. 

<Direction: Cut to a politican giving a party political broadcast in one of those badly lit sets that they use for broadcasts of that nature.> 

Politician(Terry Jones): But you know it's always very easy to blame the big bad rabbit... 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'NOW IT'S BECOME A PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST!' 

Politician(Terry Jones): ...when by-elections are going against the Government,

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'NO, SORRY, "'RELIGION TODAY" '

Preparations for an expedition are underway: equipment being piled into land-rovers etc. An interviewer walks into shot.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Hello. All the activity you can see in progress here is part of the intricate... aah! 

<Direction: he steps into a man-trap, but continues bravely the interviewer in slightly different spot with the admiral; we now see that the interviewer has a wooden leg and a crutch> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Sir Jane, what is the purpose of your expedition? 

Sir Jane(Michael Palin): Well this is a completely uncharted lake with like hitherto unclassified marine life man, so the whole scene's wide open for a scientific exploration. 

<Direction: now with a parrot on his shoulder> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): One can see the immense amount of preparation involved. Have there been many difficulties in setting up this venture? 

<Direction: with 'naval-lib' badge> 

Sir Jane(Michael Palin): Well the real hang-up was with the bread man but when the top brass pigs came through we got it together in a couple of moons. Commodore Betty Grable, who's a real sub-aqua head, has got it together diving wise and like the whole gig's been a real gas man. 

<Direction: now with Long John Silver hat and eyepatch> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Lieutenant Commander Dorothy Lamour. 

Parrot(None): Pieces of eight.

Interviewer(John Cleese): Dorothy you're in charge of security and liason for this operation. 

Dorothy Lamour(Eric Idle): Right on. 

<Direction: he is smoking something and is really cool> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): You've kept this all rather hush-hush so far shipmate. 

Dorothy Lamour(Eric Idle): Yeah, it's been really heavy man with all these freaks from the fascist press trying to blow the whole scene. 

<Direction: to camera he is hit by a dart> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Argh! A tranquillizing dart fired by the cowardly BBC health department dogs ... they've done filled me full of chlorpromazine damn! 

<Direction: He falls. A second interviewer comes into shot and catches the microphone.> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): I'm sorry about my colleague's rather unconventional behaviour. 

<Direction: running towards the camera> 

Sir Jane(Michael Palin): The navy's out of sight man come together with the RN it's really something other than else. 

<Direction: Animated psychedelic advert for the Royal Navy. You dig it, man? Cut back to second interviewer.> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Hello. I'm sorry about my colleague's rather unconventional behaviour just now, but things haven't been too easy for him recently, trouble at home, rather confidential so I can't give you all the details... interesting though they are... three bottles of rum with his Weetabix, and so on, anyway... apparently the girl wasn't even ... anyway the activity you see behind me... it's the mother I feel sorry for. I'll start again. The activity you see behind me is part of the preparations for the new Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe. The man in charge of this expedition is Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham. Sir John, hello there. 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Ah, hello. Well first of all I'd like to apologize for the behaviour of certain of my colleagues you may have seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority; and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find any toothmarks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up. And, finally, necrophilia is right out. 

<Direction: the interviewer keeps nodding but looks embarrassed> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Now, this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of cannibalism and necrophilia in... this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of unusual marine life in the as yet uncharted Lake Pahoe. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): And where exactly is the lake? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Er 22A, Runcorn Avenue, I think. Yes, that's right, 22A. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Runcorn Avenue? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Yes, it's just by Blenheim Crescent... do you know it? 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): You mean it's in an ordinary street? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Of course it's not an ordinary street! It's got a lake in it! 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Yes but I... 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Look, how many streets do you know that have got lakes in them? 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): But you mean... is it very large? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Of 

Sir John(None): course 

<Direction: looking off camera> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Jenkins ... no! 

<Direction: We see a rather sheepish rating about to sink his teeth into a human leg. Sir John puts his hand in front of the lens. Cut to Runcorn Avenue, an ordinary street with houses now turned into flats. The land-rover arrives with the equipment.> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): I'm now standing in Runcorn Avenue. Sir John ... where exactly is the lake? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Er, well let's see, that's 18... that's 20 so this must be the one. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Er, excuse me... 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Yes, that's the one all right. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): But it's an ordinary house. 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Look, I'm getting pretty irritated with this line of questioning. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): But it doesn't even look like a lake... 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Look, your whole approach since this interview started has been to mock the Navy. When I think that it was for the likes of you that I had both my legs blown off... 

<Direction: pointing at perfectly healthy legs> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): You haven't had both your legs blown off! 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): I was talking metaphorically you fool. Jenkins - put that down. 

<Direction: Jenkins returns the leg to the land-rover> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Right, is the equipment ready? 

Rating(Eric Idle): Diving equipment all ready man. 

<Direction: gives hippy salute warning finger> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Right. Now quite simply the approach to Lake Pahoe is up the steps, and then we come to the shores of the lake. Now, I'm going to press the bell just to see if there's anyone in. 

<Direction: answering> 

Man(Michael Palin): Hello? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Good morning - I'm looking for a Lake Pahoe. 

Man(Michael Palin): There's a Mr Padgett. 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): No, no a 

Sir John(None): lake 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): . 

Man(Michael Palin): There's no lake here, mate. This is Runcorn Avenue. What's the camera doing? 

<Direction: coming out grins at the camera> 

Man(Michael Palin): He's looking for a lake. 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Lake Pahoe. 

Woman(Eric Idle): Oh, you want downstairs, 22A the basement. 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Ah! Thank you very much. Good morning. Come on men, downstairs. 

<Direction: They walk down to the basement. The interviewer intercepts Sir John.> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Were you successful, Sir John? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): It's in the basement. 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): In the basement? 

<Direction: He sees a parrot on his shoulder. Pieces of eight.> 

Second Interviewer(Terry Jones): Eugh! 

<Direction: he knocks it off Sir John goes to the front door of 22A and rings. Then he looks into the living room through the window. A middle-aged couple are sitting inside. The room is full of water. The man reads the paper and the woman knits. Both wear breathing apparatus. Sir John knocks on the window. The woman looks up.> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Hello. 

Woman(John Cleese): Ooooh. I think it's someone about the damp. 

Man(Eric Idle): Tell 'em about the bleeding rats, too. 

Woman(John Cleese): I'll go 

<Direction: she swims to window and shouts out> 

Woman(John Cleese): Yes? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Good morning, is this Lake Pahoe? 

Woman(John Cleese): Well, I don't know about that, but it's bleeding damp. Are you from the council? 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): No. We are the official British Naval Expedition to this lake. May we come in? 

Woman(John Cleese): Hang on. 

<Direction: She submerges and picks up a big sign showing it to the man. The sign reads 'It's not the council, it's a British Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe or something and can they come in'. The man reads the card. An enormous shark looks over his shoulder appearing from a cupboard. The man sees it and hits it with a newspaper.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Bloody sharks. 

Woman(John Cleese): Get in. 

<Direction: He holds up a sign reading 'Tell them to go away'. The woman swims to the window and gives a V-sign to Sir John.> 

Sir John(Graham Chapman): Well um... that would appear to be the end of the expedition. 

<Direction: Cut to an interview set.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): The Magna Carta - was it a document signed at Runnymede in 1215 by King John pledging independence to the English barons, or was it a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in Dorset? The latter idea is the brainchild of a man new to the field of historical research. Mr Badger, why - why are you on this programme? 

<Direction: Pull back to show Mr Badger. He wears a flat cap and has a Scots accent.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): Well, I think I can answer this question most successfully in mime. 

<Direction: mimes incomprehensibly> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): But why Dorset? 

Badger(Eric Idle): Well, I have for a long time been suffering from a species of brain injury which I incurred during the rigours of childbirth, and I'd like to conclude by putting my finger up my nose. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Mr Badger, I think you're the silliest person we've ever had on this programme, and so I'm going to ask you to have dinner with me. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'LATER THE SAME SKETCH' 

<Direction: Cut to them sitting at a restaurant table.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): My wife Maureen ran off with a bottle of Bell's whisky during the Aberdeen versus Raith Rovers match which ended in a goalless draw. Robson particularly, in goal, had a magnificent first half, his fine positional sense preventing the build-up of any severe pressure on the suspect Aberdeen defense. McLoughlan missed an easy chance to clinch the game towards the final whistle but Raith must be well satisfied with their point. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Do please go on. This is the least fascinating conversation I've ever had. 

<Direction: A waiter comes in.> 

Waiter(Michael Palin): Would you like to order sir? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Yes, Mr Badger, what would you like to start with? 

Badger(Eric Idle): Er, I'll have a whisky to start with. 

Waiter(Michael Palin): For first course, sir? 

Badger(Eric Idle): Aye. 

Waiter(Michael Palin): And for main course, sir? 

Badger(Eric Idle): I'll have a whisky for main course and I'll follow that with a whisky for pudding. 

Waiter(Michael Palin): Yes sir, and what would you like with it, sir? A whisky? 

Badger(Eric Idle): No, a bottle of wine. 

Waiter(Michael Palin): Fine, sir, he said between clenched teeth knowing full well it was a most unrewarding part. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in. 

Badger(Eric Idle): Shall we stop it? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Yeah, all right. 

<Direction: they get up and walk out> 

None(None): CAPTION: 'THE END' 

None(None): CREDITS 

<Direction: A light comes up on an organ in the centre of a concert-hall stage. Applause. The organist with wild hair (Terry J) appears from left. He walks fully clothed across to the organ looking pleased with himself. He sits at the organ and raises his hands...his clothes fly up in the air so that, as per normal, he is naked. He plays the usual chords. Cut on the last note to a naked quartet with identical grins, fright wigs and blacked-out teeth staring maniacally at the camera.>

Secretary(None): Sorry. 

Biggles(Graham Chapman): I've never even been to Spain. 

Secretary(None): You went to Ibiza last year.

Secretary(None): And how would

Biggles(Graham Chapman): And just what do you mean by that? Are you calling my old fictional comrade-in-arms a fairy? 

Secretary(None): Fairy! Poof's not good enough for Algy, is it? He's got to be a bleedin' fairy. Mincing old RAF queen. 

<Direction: sits at the desk into the intercom> 

Biggles(Graham Chapman): Algy, I have to see you. 

Algy(Michael Palin): Right ho.

Secretary(None): Oh. 

Biggles(Graham Chapman): Ginger. 

Ginger(Terry Gilliam): Hello, sweetie. 

Biggles(Graham Chapman): I have to see you. 

<Direction: The door opens, Ginger enters as a terrible poof in camp flying gear, sequins, eye make-up, silver stars on his cheeks.> 

Ginger(Terry Gilliam): Yes, Biggles? 

Biggles(Graham Chapman): Are you a poof 

<Direction: camp outrage>

Voice Over(John Cleese): Next week part two - 'Biggles Flies Undone'. 

<Direction: Then a very noisy and violent animation sketch.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): Meanwhile not very far away. 

<Direction: Cut to mountain climbers, with all the accoutrements: ropes, carabino's, helmets, pitons, hammers, etc. They are roped together, apparently climbing a mountain.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Climbing. The world's loneliest sport, where hardship and philosophy go hand in glove. And here, another British expedition, attempting to be the first man to successfully climb the north face of the Uxbridge Road. 

<Direction: Pull out to reveal that they are climbing along a wide pavement; a shopper pushing a pram comes into shot> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): This four-man rope has been climbing tremendously. BBC cameras were there to film every inch. 

<Direction: Cut to a BBC cameraman clinging to a lamppost, filming. He is wearing climbing gear too. Cut to papier mache model of the Uxbridge Road, with the route all neatly marked out in white, and various little pins for the camps. voice over cut to a pup tent being firmly planted on the side of a large post-box; it has a little union jack on it.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well they've spent a good night in there last night in preparation for the final assault today. The leader of the expedition is twenty-nine-year-old Bert Tagg - a local headmaster and mother of three. 

<Direction: Cut to Bert crawling along the pavement. The interviewer is crouching down beside him.> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Bert. How's it going? 

Bert(Graham Chapman): Well, it's a bit gripping is this, Chris. 

<Direction: heavy breathing interspersed rearranging rope> 

Bert(Graham Chapman): damn ... I'm doing it, er, by laying back on this gutter so I'm kind of guttering and laying back at the same time, and philosophizing. 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Bert, some people say this is crazy. 

Bert(Graham Chapman): Aye, well but they said Crippen was crazy didn't they? 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Crippen 

Interviewer(None): was 

Interviewer(John Cleese): crazy. 

Bert(Graham Chapman): Oh, well there you are then. 

<Direction: shouts there is a white rope between Bert and John Quick cut to Viking.> 

Viking(Michael Palin): Lemon curry? 

<Direction: Cut back to the street.> 

Bert(Graham Chapman): Now you see he's putting a peg down there because I'm quite a way up now, and if I come unstuck here I go down quite a long way. 

<Direction: leaving him> 

Interviewer(John Cleese): Such quiet courage is typical of the way these brave chaps shrug off danger. Like it or not, you've got to admire the skill that goes into it. 

<Direction: By the miracle of stop action, they all fall off the road, back down the pavement. Passers-by, also in stop action, walk by normally, ignoring the fall.> 

None(None): Cut to an ordinary kitchen. A Mrs Pinnet type lady with long apron and headscarf is stuffing a chicken with various unlikely objects. The door opens. Sound of rain, wind and storm outside. A liftboatman enters, soaked to the skin. He shuts the door. 

<Direction: taking off his sou'wester and shaking the water off it> 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Oh it's terrible up on deck. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Up on deck? 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Yes on deck. It's diabolical weather. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): What deck, dear? 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): The deck, The deck of the lifeboat. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): This isn't a lifeboat, dear. This is 24, Parker Street. 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): This is the Newhaven Lifeboat. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): No it's not, dear. 

<Direction: The First Lifeboatman puts on his sou'wester, goes over to the back door and opens it, He peers out. Sound of wind and lashing rain. Cut to the back door at the side of a suburban home, the lifeboatman looking out over the lawns, flowers and windless, rainless calm across to similar neat suburban houses. The noise cuts. The liftboatman withdraws his head from the door. Sound of wind and rain again which cease abruptly as he withdraws his head and shuts the door.> 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at all. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): No, I wouldn't live here if it was, 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Do you mind if I sit down for a minute and collect my wits? 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): No, you do that, I'll make you a nice cup of tea. 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Thanks very much. 

<Direction: The door flies open. More sound of wind and rain. Two other rain-soaked lifeboatmen appear.> 

Second Lifeboatman(Graham Chapman): Oooh, it's a wild night up top. 

Third Lifeboatman(Terry Gilliam): Your turn on deck soon, Charlie. 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): It's not a lifeboat, Frank. 

Third Lifeboatman(Terry Gilliam): What? 

Second Lifeboatman(Graham Chapman): What do you mean? 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): It's not a lifeboat. It's this lady's house. 

<Direction: The two lifeboatmen look at each other, then turn and open the door. Sound of wind and rain as usual. They peer out. Cut to the back door - the two lifeboatmen are peering out. They shout. Captain! Captain! Ahoy there! Ahoy there! Captain!! Their voices carry over the following shot or two. Cut to reverse angle of window across the road. A net curtain moves and an eye peers out. We still hear the shouts. Close up on an elderly spinster (Gladys) holding the net curtain discreetly ajar.> 

Enid(Eric Idle): Who's that shouting? 

<Direction: We pull out to reveal a sitting room full of high-powered eavesdropping equipment, i.e. an enormous telescope on wheels with a controller's chair attached to it, several subsidiary telescopes pointing out of the window, radar scanners going round and round, two computers with flashing lights, large and complex tape and video recorders, several TV monitors, oscilloscopes, aerials, etc. All these have been squeezed in amongst the furniture of two retired middle-class old ladies. Enid, a dear old lady with a bun, sits at the control seat of an impressive-looking console, pressing buttons. She also has some knitting.> 

Gladys(John Cleese): It's a man outside Number 24. 

Enid(Eric Idle): Try it on the five inch, Gladys. 

<Direction: looking at the array of telescopes> 

Gladys(John Cleese): I can't. I've got that fixed on the Baileys at Number 13. Their new lodger moves in today. 

Enid(Eric Idle): All fight, hold 13 on the five-inch and transfer the Cartwrights to the digital scanner. 

<Direction: Gladys leaps over to the tape deck, presses levers and switches. Sound of tape reversing. There is a hum and lights flash on and off. A blurred image of a lady in the street comes up on one of the monitors.> 

Enid(Eric Idle): Hold on, Mrs Pettigrew's coming back from the doctor's. 

Gladys(John Cleese): All right, bring her up on two. What's the duration reading on the oscillator? 

Enid(Eric Idle): 48.47. 

Gladys(John Cleese): Well that's a long time for someone who's just had a routine checkup. 

<Direction: reading a graph on a computer> 

Enid(Eric Idle): Yes, her pulse rate's 146! 

Gladys(John Cleese): Zoom in on the 16mm and hold her, Enid. 

Enid(Eric Idle): Roger, Gladys. 

Gladys(John Cleese): I'll try and get her on the twelve-inch. 

<Direction: she dips into the control seat of the huge mobile telescope; we cut to the view through Gladys's telescope - out of focus at first, but then sharper as she zooms in towards the side door of Number 24 the curtain is opened a little> 

Gladys(John Cleese): Thank you, love. 

<Direction: Cut to the interior of Mrs Neves's kitchen once again. It is absolutely full of lifeboatmen. They are all talking happily and drinking cups of tea. We pick up the conversation between two them.> 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Yes, it's one of those new self-righting models. Newhaven was about the first place in the country to get one. 

Second Lifeboatman(Graham Chapman): What's the displacement on one of them jobs then? 

First Lifeboatman(Michael Palin): Oh it's about 140-150 per square inch. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Who's for fruit cake? 

All(None): Oh yes, please, please. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Yes, right, macaroons, that's two dozen fruit cakes, half a dozen macaroons. Right ho. Won't be a jiffy then. 

<Direction: She puts a scarf on, picks up a basket and goes out of the front door. As she opens door, we hear the sound of a storm which carries us into the next shot. Cut to the deck of a lifeboat; rain-lashed, heaving, wind-tossed Mrs Neves struggles against the gale force winds along the deck. She hammers on a hatch in the forward part of the lifeboat.> 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Yoohoo! Mrs Edwards! 

<Direction: The hatch opens and a cosy shop-keeping pepperpot sticks her head out.> 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): Hello. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Hello, two dozen fruit cakes and half a dozen macaroons. 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): Sorry love, no macaroons. How about a nice vanilla sponge? 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): Yes, that'll be lovely. 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): Right ho. 

<Direction: sound of a ship's horn; they both look she produces a loudhailer> 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): Hello, Captain Smith? 

Voice(None): Hallooooo! 

<Direction: Mrs Edwards hurls a box of Kup Kakes off deck.> 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): Kup Kakes to starboard. 

Voice(None): Coming. 

Mrs Neves(Terry Jones): I'll pay you at the end of the week, all right? 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): OK, right ho.

Officer(Michael Palin): By the way, do you do lunches? 

Mrs Edwards(Graham Chapman): No, morning coffee and teas only. 

Officer(Michael Palin): Right ho. 

<Direction: holding the teas he goes up to edge and jumps overboard Cut to very quick series of stills of storage jars.> 

None(None): CAPTION: 'STORAGE JARS' 

<Direction: Urgent documentary music. Mix through to an impressive documentary set. Zoom in to presenter in a swivel chair. He swings around to face the camera.> 

Presenter(Eric Idle): Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'Storage Jars'. On tonight's programme Mikos Antoniarkis, the Greek rebel leader who seized power in Athens this morning, tells us what he keeps in storage jars. 

<Direction: quick cut to photo of a guerrilla leader with a gun; sudden dramatic chord; instantly cut back to the presenter still of a Bolivian city and again dramatic chord and instantly back to the presenter> 

Presenter(Eric Idle): And closer to home, the first dramatic pictures of the mass jail-break near the storage jar factory in Maidenhead. All this and more in 'Storage Jars'! 

<Direction: Cut to a road in front of a heap of smouldering rubble. Dull thuds of mortars. Reporter in short sleeves standing in tight shot. Explosions going off behind him at intervals.> 

Rodgers(Terry Jones): This is La Paz, Bolivia, behind me you can hear the thud of mortars and the high-pitched whine of rockets, as the battle for control of this volatile republic shakes the foundations of this old city. 

<Direction: slowly we pull out during this until we see in front of him a fairly long trestle table set out with range of diffrent-sized storage jar the explosions continue behind him> 

Rodgers(Terry Jones): Here the largest size is used for rice and for mangoes - a big local crop. Unlike most revolutionary South American states they've an intermediary size in between the 2 lb and 5 lb jars. This gives this poor but proud people a useful jar for apricots, plums and stock cubes. The smallest jar - this little 2oz jar, for sweets, chocolates and even little shallots. No longer used in the West it remains here as an unspoken monument to the days when La Paz knew better times. Ronald Rodgers, 'Storage Jars', La Paz. 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: television is bad for your eyes. and CAPTION: Cut to a man sitting at a desk with a script.> 

Mr Tussaud(Terry Jones): Hello, the, er, show so far...well it all started with the organist losing all his clothes as he sat down at the organ, and after this had happened and we had seen the titles of the show, we saw Biggles dictating a letter to his secretary, who thought he was Spanish, and whom he referred to as a harlot and a woman of the night, although she preferred to be called a courtesan. Then we saw some people trying to climb a road in Uxbridge. And then there were some cartoons and then some lifeboatmen came into a woman's sitting room and after a bit the woman went out to buy some cakes on a lifeboat and then a naval officer jumped into the sea. Then we saw a man telling us about storage jars from Bolivia, then there were some more cartoons and a man told us about what happened on the show so far and a great hammer came down and hit him on the head. 

<Direction: he frowns a big hammer hits him on the head Quick cut to 'It's' man.> 

It's Man(Michael Palin): Lemon curry? 

<Direction: A montage of photographs. The cutting from photo to photo is pretty fast. Greek music is heard. Starting with: a close up of Mousebender, who is respectable and wears smart casual clothes; various photos of Mousebender walking along the pavement, again very artily shot from show-off angles; Mousebender pausing outside a shop; Mousebender looking up at the shop; Edwardian-style shop with large sign above it reading 'Ye Olde Cheese Emporium'; another sign below the first reading 'Henry Wensleydale, Purveyor of Fine Cheese to the Gentry and the Poverty Stricken Too'; another sign below this reading 'Licensed for Public Dancing'; close up of Mousebender looking pleased; shot of Mousebender entering the shop. Music cuts dead. Cut to interior of the cheese shop. Greek music playing as Mousebender enters. Two men dressed as city gents are Greek dancing in the corner to the music of a bouzouki. The shop itself is large and redolent of the charm and languidity of a bygone age. There is actually no cheese to be seen either on or behind the counter but this is not obvious. Mousebender approaches the counter and rings a small handbell. Wensleydale appears.> 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Good morning, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole, when suddenly I came over all peckish. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Peckish, sir? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Esurient.

Mousebender(John Cleese): I want to buy some cheese. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Oh, I thought you were complaining about the music! 

<Direction: normal voice> 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Heaven forbid. I am one who delights in all manifestations of the terpsichorean muse. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Sorry? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): I like a nice dance - you're forced to. 

<Direction: Quick cut to a Viking. broad Northern accent> 

Viking(Michael Palin): Anyway. 

<Direction: Cut back to cheese shop.> 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Who said that? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Now my good man, some cheese, please. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes certainly, sir. What would you like? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Well, how about a little Red Leicester. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Tish tish. No matter. Well, four ounces of Caerphilly, then, if you please, stout yeoman. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Ah well, it's been on order for two weeks, sir, I was expecting it this morning. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Yes, it's not my day, is it? Er, Bel Paese? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Sorry. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Red Windsor? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Normally, sir, yes, but today the van broke down.

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Ah! We do have some Camembert, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): You do! Excellent. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): It's a bit runny, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Oh, I like it runny. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Well as a matter of fact it's 

Wensleydale(None): very 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): runny, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): No matter. No matter. Hand over le fromage de la Belle France qui s'apelle Camembert, s'il vous plaÃ®t. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): I think it's runnier than you like it, sir. 

<Direction: smiling grimley> 

Mousebender(John Cleese): I don't care how excrementally runny it is. Hand it over with all speed. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes, sir. 

<Direction: bends below counter and reappears> 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Oh... 

Mousebender(John Cleese): What? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): The cat's eaten it. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Has he? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): She, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Gouda? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Edam? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Caithness? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Smoked Austrian? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Sage Darby? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): No, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): You do have some cheese, do you? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Certainly, sir. It's a cheese shop, sir. We've got... 

Mousebender(John Cleese): No, no, no, don't tell me. I'm keen to guess. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Fair enough. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Wensleydale. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes, sir? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Splendid. Well, I'll have some of that then, please. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Oh, I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reffering to me, Mr Wensleydale. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Gorgonzola? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Parmesan? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Mozzarella? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Pippo CrÃ¨me? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Any Danish Fynbo? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Czechoslovakian Sheep's Milk Cheese? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Venezuelan Beaver Cheese? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Not today sir, no. 

<Direction: pause> 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Well let's keep it simple, how about Cheddar? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Well, I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world! 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Not round these parts, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Ilchester, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): I see. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes, sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor, squire. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Is it. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes sir, it's our number-one seller. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Yes sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Ilchester, eh? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Right. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): OK, I'm game. Have you got any, he asked, expecting the answer no? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): I'll have a look, sir...nnnnnnooooooooo. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Finest in the district, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): And what leads you to that conclusion? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Well, it's so clean. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese. 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): You haven't asked me about Limberger, sir. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Is it worth it? 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Could be. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): OK, have you... 

Mousebender(None): will you shut that bloody dancing up! 

<Direction: the music stops to dancers> 

Wensleydale(Michael Palin): Told you so. 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Have you got any Limberger? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): No, that figures. It was pretty predictable, really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something, do you have any cheese at all? 

Mousebender(John Cleese): Now I'm going to ask you that question once more, and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now, do you have any cheese at all? 

<Direction: shoots him> 

Mousebender(John Cleese): What a senseless waste of human life. 

<Direction: Mousebender puts a cowboy hat on his head. Cut to stock shot of man on horse riding into the sunset. Music swells dramatically.>

Philip Jenkinson(Eric Idle): one of the first of the Cheese Westerns to be later followed by 'Gunfight at GruyÃ¨re Corral', 'Ilchester 73', and 'The Cheese Who Shot Liberty Valence'. While I'm on the subject of Westerns, I want to take a closer look at one of my favourite film directors, Sam Peckinpah, the expatriate from Fresno, California.

Philip Jenkinson(Eric Idle): In his earliest films, 'Major Dundee',

Lionel(Michael Palin): I say what a simply super day. 

All(None): Gosh yes. 

Woman(None): It's so, you know, sunny. 

Lionel(Michael Palin): Yes isn't it? I say anyone for tennis? 

Julian(Graham Chapman): Oh super! 

Charles(Eric Idle): What fun. 

Julian(Graham Chapman): I say, Lionel, catch. 

<Direction: He throws the tennis ball to Lionel. It hits Lionel on the head. Lionel claps one hand to his forehead. He roars in pain as blood seeps through his fingers.> 

Lionel(Michael Palin): Oh gosh. 

<Direction: He tosses his racket out of frame and we hear a hideous scream. The camera pans to pick up a pretty girl in summer frock with the handle of the racket embedded in her stomach. Blood is pouring out down her dress. Oh crikey. Spitting blood out of her mouth she collapses onto the floor clutching at Charles's arm. The arm comes off. Buckets of blood burst out of the shoulder drenching the girl and anyone else in the area. He staggers backwards against the piano. The piano lid drops, severing the pianist's hands. The pianist screams. He stands, blood spurting from his hands over piano music. The piano collapses in slow motion, shot from several angles simultaneously as per 'Zabriskie Point'. Intercut terrified faces of girls screaming in slow motion. The piano eventually crushes them to death; an enormous pool of blood immediately swells up from beneath piano where the girls are. We see Julian stagger across the frame with the piano keyboard through his stomach. As he turns the end of the keyboard knocks off the head of a terrified girl who is sitting on the grass nearby. A volcanic quantity of blood geysers upwards. Pull out and upward from this scene as the music starts again. Cut back to Philip Jenkinson.>

Announcer(John Cleese): Look there's not really a great deal of point in your, sort of hanging on at your end, because I'm afraid there aren't any more jokes or anything. 

<Direction: He walks out of shot. We stay with the film for quite a long time before we finally fade out. The green lush Devon countryside. Theme music. The camera is tracking along a hedgerow beside the road. We see a head whizzing along, sometimes just above the hedgerow and sometimes bobbing out of sight, accasionally for long periods.> 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE CYCLING TOUR' 

<Direction: Mr. Pither, the cyclist, bobs up and down a few more times, then disappears from sight. There is a crash and clang of a bicycle in collision, mixed with the scream of a frightened hen, and stifled shout of alarm. We are still in long shot and see nothing. The music stops abruptly on the crash. voice over> 

Pither(Michael Palin): August 18th. Fell off near Bovey Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg. 

<Direction: Cut to interior of a transport cafe. A rather surly proprietor with fag in mouth is operating an Espresso coffee machine. Pither, a fussy bespectacled little man, in sweater, trousers, is leaning over the counter, talking chattily.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my sandwiches were badly crushed. 

Proprietor(Eric Idle): 35p please. 

<Direction: He goes back to working the machine.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): These sandwiches, however, were an excellent substitute. 

<Direction: Enormous lorry driver comes up to counter.> 

Driver(John Cleese): Give us ten woods, Barney. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Hello! 

<Direction: the lorry driver looks at him without interest the driver goes off with his cigarettes> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Ah! I have only a fifty. Do you have change? 

<Direction: with heavy sarcasm> 

Proprietor(Eric Idle): Well I'll have a look, but I may have to go to the bank. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I'm most awfully sorry. 

<Direction: handing him change> 

Proprietor(Eric Idle): 15p. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, what a stroke of luck. Well, all the very best. 

<Direction: Pither proffers his hand, the proprietor ignores it> 

Pither(Michael Palin): And thank you again for the excellent banana and cheese delicacy. 

<Direction: He exits busily. The proprietor looks after him. Cut to hedgerows. Theme music. Pither's head bobbing up and down. At the same point in the music it disappears and there is a crash mingled with grunting of pig.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh Salterton. 

<Direction: A brief shot of an unindentifiable animated Gilliam monster looking over the top of a hedge. Cut to a woman gardening. Behind her we see Pither's head peering over the hedge.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): ...and the pump caught in my trouser leg... 

<Direction: she carries on digging trying to ignore him no reaction she goes on digging again no reaction> 

Pither(Michael Palin): That shouldn't really happen to a self-sealing container, should it? What do you keep your hard-boiled eggs in? 

<Direction: The lady gardener goes back into house. Pither waits for a few moments. shouting> 

Pither(Michael Palin): I think in future I shall lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape...this should obviate a recurrence of the same problem...well I can't stop here all day...I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall. Must be off. 

<Direction: Cut to hedgerows again. Pither's head bowling along. Theme music. He dips out of sight. Crash and a cow moos.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): August 26th. Fell off near Ottery St Mary. The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decided to wear short trousers from now on. 

<Direction: Another brief shot of the animated monster peeking over a hedgerow. Cut to another hedgerow. Pither's head bowling along. Short burst of music. Crash.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter pump is the answer. 

<Direction: Another monster peeps briefly. Cut to a tiny village high street, deserted save for an old lady. Pither cycles into shot. He is in shorts, but still has his bicycle clips on. He approaches the old lady.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Excuse me, madam, I wonder if you could tell me of a good bicycle shop in this village, where I could find either a means of adapting my present pump, or failing that, purchase a replacement? 

Old lady(Eric Idle): There's only one shop here. 

<Direction: She points with a shaking finger. Camera pans very slightly to one side to reveal a shop with a huge four-foot-high sign: 'Bicycle Pump Centre - Specialists In Shorter Bicycle Pumps'. Another sign: 'Short Pumps Available Here'. Another sign: 'We Shorten Pumps While-U-Wait'. The camera shows the shop only for a couple of seconds and pans back to the old lady and Pither.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will become less precarious. 

<Direction: Cut to interior of doctor's surgery. There is a knock on the door. .> 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Yes? (a nurse puts her head round the door) 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): A Mr Pither to see you, doctor. His bicycle pump got caught in his sock. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Oh, thank you nurse, show him in please. 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): This way, please. 

<Direction: The nurse exits, Pither enters in shorts and sweater.> 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Morning. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, a very good morning to you too, Doctor 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Ah, I understand you had an accident? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Yes, my pump got... 

Doctor(Eric Idle): ...caught in your sock. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Absolutely. Yes. My fruit cake was damaged on one side. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Well... 

Pither(Michael Palin): It's got grit all over it. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Well now, are you in pain? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, heavens no. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Ah well, where were you hurt? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, fortunately, I escaped without injury. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Well what is the trouble? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Please, could you tell me the way to Iddesleigh? 

Doctor(Eric Idle): I'm a doctor, you know. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh yes, absolutely. Normally I would have asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one available, I thought it better to consult a man with some professional qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony of a passer-by. 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Oh alright. 

<Direction: he scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to Pither> 

Doctor(Eric Idle): Take this to a chemist. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Thank you. 

<Direction: Cut to exterior of a chemist's shop. A chemist comes out holding the paper and points up the street. Pither thanks him and mounts his bike. Cut to the hedgerows again. Pither's head. Theme music reaches the point where Pither normally falls off, his head disappears, the music cuts off. There is no crash. Suddenly Pither's head reappears further on and the music starts up again.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): September 2nd. Did not fall off outside Iddesley. 

<Direction: Cut to a small market town. A line of cars. Pither's head just above roofs of cars. Theme music. He suddenly disappears, the music stops and there is a crash.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Fell off in Tavistock. 

<Direction: Cut to a discreet corner of a Watney's pub. Soft music. A middle-aged businessman and a sexy secretary who obviously want to be alone are sitting huddled over a table. At the next table is Pither, with half-pint in front of him.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): My foot caught in my trouser leg and that's how the bottle broke. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Tell her today, you could ring her. 

Man(John Cleese): I can't. I can't. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I said you'd never guess. 

Man(John Cleese): Sixteen years we've been together. I can't just ring her up. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Well, if you can't do it now, you never will. 

<Direction: tapping the man on the leg> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Do you like Tizer? 

<Direction: to Pither> 

Man(John Cleese): What? No. No. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Do you want me or not, James? It's your decision. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I suppose it is still available in this area, is it? 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Do you want me or not, James? 

Man(John Cleese): What? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Tizer. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Yes or no. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Is it still available in this area? 

Man(John Cleese): I don't know. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): I see, in that case it's goodbye for ever, James. 

Man(John Cleese): No! I mean yes! 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh it is, is it? 

Man(John Cleese): No. 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Oh! You never could make up your mind. 

Man(John Cleese): I can.... I have.... 

<Direction: taking off ring> 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Goodbye James. 

<Direction: She runs out sobbing.> 

Man(John Cleese): No wait, Lucille! 

Pither(Michael Palin): Does your lovely daughter like Tizer? Eh? 

Man(John Cleese): Lucille! 

Pither(Michael Palin): Wouldn't mind buying her a bottle of Tizer.... if it's available in this area, that is. 

<Direction: turning on Pither> 

Man(John Cleese): Would you like me to show you the door? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, that's extremely kind of you, but I saw it on the way in. 

Man(John Cleese): You stupid, interfering little rat. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude! 

<Direction: The man picks Pither up by the scruff of the neck and the seat of his pants. He carries him bodily towards the door.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): I had just fallen off my bicycle, this is most kind of you, and my lemon curd tartlet had... 

Man(John Cleese): Damn your lemon curd tartlet! 

<Direction: Pither is thrown out. He picks himself up and sees girl outside sobbing.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Just had a chat with your dad. 

<Direction: Girl bursts into further tears. Whistling cheerfully, Pither gets on his bicycle and, happier than he has been for a long time, he cycles off down the road and round a corner. Sounds of car-tyre screech and crash of Pither going straight into a car. Cut to interior of car speeding along highway. Pither is sitting in the back seat with his bicycle. The driver, Mr Gulliver, talks with a professional precision.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): My rubber instep caught on the rear mudguard stanchion and... 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Really? And what happened to the corned beef rolls? 

Pither(Michael Palin): The corned beef rolls squashed out of all...here, how did you know about the corned beef rolls? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I noticed them - or what remained of them - in the road. I noticed also that the lemon curd tart had sustained some superficial damage. 

Pither(Michael Palin): That's right. The curd had become... 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Detached from the pastry base. 

<Direction: with some surprise> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Absolutely right, yes. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Otherwise the contents of the sandwich box were relatively unharmed, although I detected small particles of bitumen in the chocolate kup kakes. 

Pither(Michael Palin): But they were wrapped in foil! 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Not the hard chocolate top, I'm afraid. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, that's the bit I like. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): The sausage roll, the crisps and ginger bisquit were unscathed. 

Pither(Michael Palin): How do you know so much about cycling? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Well, I'm making a special study of accidents involving food. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Really? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Yes, do you know that in our laboratories, we have developed a cheese sandwich that can withstand an impact of 4,000 pounds per square inch? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Good heavens! 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Amazing, isn't it? We have also developed a tomato which can eject itself when an accident is imminent. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Even if it's inside an egg and tomato roll? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Anywhere! Even if it's in your stomach, and it senses an accident it will come up your throat and out of the window. Do you realise what this means? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Safer food? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Exactly! No longer will food be squashed, crushed and damaged, by the ignorance and stupidity of the driver! 

<Direction: becoming slightly messianic> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Whole picnics will be built to withstand the most enormous forces! Snacks will be safer than ever! An simple pot of salad dressing, treated in our laboratories, has been subjected to the impact of a 4,000 pound steam hammer every day for the last sixteen years and has it broken? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Er....well... 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Yes, of course it has...but there are other ideas - the safety straps for sardines for instance. 

<Direction: A tomato leaps up out of the glove compartment and hovers, then it ejects itself out of the car window> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Here, that tomato just ejected itself. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Really? 

<Direction: embracing Pither excitedly the car crashes Fade out. Fade up on country road. Pither is cycling along with Gulliver on the back of the bicycle. Gulliver has his head bandaged and his arm in a sling. Occasionally strains of Clodagh Rogers hit 'Jack in a box' float towards us as Gulliver moves rhythmically. voice over> 

Pither(Michael Palin): What a strange turn this cycling tour has taken. Mr Gulliver appears to have lost his memory and far from being interested in safer food is now convinced that he is Clodagh Rogers, the young girl singer. I am taking him for medical attention. 

<Direction: Cut to Pither and Gulliver cycling into hospital. A sign says 'North Cornwall District Hospital'. Cut to nurse receptionist at a counter with a glass window which lifts up and down. Pither appears.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Is this the Casualty Department? 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Yes, that's right. 

<Direction: Noise of splintering wood and crash out of vision. Pither and the nurse look up. A bench has collapsed in the middle and three patients sitting on it have slid into a heap in the middle. A nurse is on her way to assist. Cut back to Pither and nurse.> 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): And what can I do for you? 

<Direction: The window comes down on her fingers, she winces sharply in pain. She pushes it up again.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): I am at present on a cycling tour of the North Cornwall area taking in Bude and... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Could I have your name please? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Ah, my name is Pither. 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): What? 

Pither(Michael Palin): P-I-T-H-E-R ...as in Brotherhood, but with PI instead of the BRO and no HOOD. 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): I see... 

Pither(Michael Palin): I had just visited Taunton... 

<Direction: Terrific crash. Cut to trolley on its side, and a bandaged patient under a mound of hospital instruments and a nurse standing looking down.> 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Sh! 

Pither(Michael Palin): ...and was cycling north towards... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Yes, where were you injured? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Just where the A397 Ilfracombe road meets the... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): On your 

Nurse(None): body 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): ... 

Pither(Michael Palin): Ah no... it's not I who was injured, it's my friend. 

<Direction: Nurse scowls, crumples up paper, and throws it away. The piece of paper hits a smallish cabinet of glass which topples forward and smashes.> 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Tut... Name? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Pither. 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): No, no, no, no. Your friend's name. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, Clodagh Rogers... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Clodagh Rogers!? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Well only since about 4:30.... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Yes. I think you'd better talk to Doctor Wu... Doctor! 

<Direction: Cut to a doctor unloading a crate balanced on top of a medicine. He whips round knocking off the crate.> 

Doctor(John Cleese): What? Damn! 

<Direction: Cut to patient in a wheelchair being pushed. The wheelchair completely collapses and the nurse is left holding the handles. Quick cut to the nurse as window comes down on her fingers again.> 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): Aaaaaagh! 

<Direction: Doctor comes across to pither, limping slightly, in some pain.> 

Doctor(John Cleese): Now, what's the trouble? 

Pither(Michael Palin): I am on a cycling tour of... 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): He 

Nurse(None): thinks 

Nurse(Graham Chapman): he's had an accident. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I have friend who, as a result of his injuries thinks he is Clodagh Rogers. 

Doctor(John Cleese): He what? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Well, what happened was... 

<Direction: A nurse carrying a tray walks past the doctor, making for the entrance doors. As she reaches them they swing open to admit Gulliver, with his head bandaged and his arm in a sling. He collides with the nurse; she drops her tray. He graps Pither and they exit rapidly, stepping on the doctor's foot in the process. The doctor yells, grabs his foot, and as he does so the reception window slamms down, trapping his hand. He howls in pain. Cut to a camp fire at midnight in a forest clearing. By the light of the fire, Pither is writing up his diary. voice over Gulliver enters the scene; his head is still bandaged> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh hello! 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): We cannot stay here. We must leave immediately. There is a ship in Marseilles. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I did enjoy your song for Europe, Clodagh. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I have seen an agent in the town. My life is in danger. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Danger, Clodagh? 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Stalin has always hated me. 

Pither(Michael Palin): No one hates you, Clodagh. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I will not let myself fall into the hands of these scum. 

Pither(Michael Palin): I think you should go and have a little lie down, my dear. There is a busy day tomorrow of concerts and promotional tours. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I. One of the founders of the greatest nation on earth. I! Whom Lenin has called his greatest friend. 

<Direction: From the darkness we hear French voices.> 

M. Brun(John Cleese): Taisez-vous. Taisez-vous. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh dear. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I! Who have worked all my life that my people should live. 

<Direction: A pair of middle class French people in pyjamas appear.> 

M. Brun(John Cleese): Taisez-vous. Qu'est-ce que le bruit? C'est impossible! 

Pither(Michael Palin): Er... my name is Pither. 

M. Brun(John Cleese): Oh... you are English? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Er yes, that's right. I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall, taking in Bude... 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I will not be defeated. I will return to my country to fight against this new tyranny! 

Pither(Michael Palin): This is Clodagh Rogers, the Irish-born girl singer. 

Mme. Brun(Eric Idle): Mais oui - c'est Clodagh Rogers - 'Jack-in-a-box'! 

<Direction: sings calls> 

Mme. Brun(Eric Idle): Genevieve! Gerard! C'est Clodagh Rogers la fameuse chanteuse Anglaise.

Bag(John Cleese): None at all. Come with us. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, where are you taking me? 

<Direction: The secret police all move away to confer.> 

Wallet(Graham Chapman): What do we tell him?

<Direction: They return to Pither.> 

Wallet(Graham Chapman): We're taking you to a clambake.

Grip(Eric Idle): Right, let's go. 

Bag(John Cleese): Who's giving the orders round here? 

Grip(Eric Idle): I am. I'm senior to you. 

Bag(John Cleese): No, you're not. You're a greengrocer, I'm an insurance salesman. 

Grip(Eric Idle): Greengrocers are senior to insurance salesmen.

Superimposed names zoom into camera, as in a musical: Petrograd, Ottograd, Lewgrad, Lesliegrad, Etceteragrad, Dukhovskoknabilebskohatsk, Moscva. Cut to the stage of a big Russian hall. A banner across the top of the stage reads 'Russian 42nd International Clambake'. At the back of the stage sits Pither with his bicycle. At one side of the stage, at an impressive table on a dais, are some very important Russian persons including generals. One of the generals addresses the audience. General>

None(None): SUBTITLE: 'FORGIVE ME IF I CONTINUE IN ENGLISH IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME' 

General(John Cleese): And now, Comrades, the greatest moment of the day, the moment when I ask you to welcome the return of one of Russia's greatest heroes, creator of the Red Army, Lenin's greatest friend, Lev Davidovich Trotsky! 

<Direction: Gulliver appears looking as much like Trotsky as possible. He wears a uniform and has a beard and glasses. Pandemonium breaks out. He eventually quietens them by raising his hands for silence.> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Comrades. Bolsheviks. Friends of the Revolution. I have returned. 

<Direction: renewed cheering his movements are becoming a little camp and slinky sings a certain amount of confusion is spreading among the audience and particulary the general on the podium> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): I want an old-fashioned house with an old-fashioned fence, and an old-fashioned millionaire. 

<Direction: From now on Gulliver continues exactly as Eartha Kitt. He has aquired a fur stole which he manipulates slinkily. The confusion is complete on the stage. voice over> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Our friend Mr Gulliver was clearly undergoing another change of personality. 

<Direction: A senior general appears beside Pither with two guards.> 

General(John Cleese): So! You have duped us. You shall pay for this. Guards, seize him. 

<Direction: The guards seize the startled Pither and drag him away. The senior general strides back across the stage avoiding Gulliver, towards the general who addressed the audience.> 

General(John Cleese): Shall I seize him too? 

Senior General(Graham Chapman): No, I think we'll have to keep him, he's going down well. 

General(John Cleese): He's more fun than he used to be. 

Senior General(Graham Chapman): He's loosened up a lot. This is an old Lenin number. 

<Direction: Cut to Pither sitting in a cell. two Russian guards throw the cell door open they grab him and march him out of cell Cut to exterior of a door leading out into prison yard. The door is thrown open and Pither is marched over and stood against a blank wall. There are lots of small holes in the wall.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): What a pleasant exercise yard. How friendly they were all being. 

Officer(John Cleese): Cigarettes? 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh, no thank you I don't smoke. 

<Direction: Pither facing a line of uniformed men with guns, obviously a firing squad. cut to Pither against the wall looking behind him> 

Pither(Michael Palin): I looked around but could not see the target. 

Officer(John Cleese): Blindfold? 

<Direction: very cheerful> 

Pither(Michael Palin): No thank you, no. 

<Direction: stepping clear the firing squad snaps to attention they raise their rifles> 

Officer(John Cleese): Verschnitzen. 

<Direction: Drum roll. The firing squad takes aim. A messenger runs frantically up.> 

Messenger(Graham Chapman): Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

Officer(John Cleese): How could you miss? 

Soldier(Eric Idle): He moved. 

Officer(John Cleese): Shut up! Go and practise. 

<Direction: to Pither> 

Officer(John Cleese): I'm so sorry. Do you mind waiting in your cell? 

<Direction: Pither is flung back in his cell by the guards, and the door slammed.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): What a stroke of luck. My Crunchie was totally intact. I settled down to a quick intermeal snack... 

<Direction: But he is bundled out again. Pause. Shots. He si bundled in. The officer appears at door.> 

Officer(John Cleese): Next time. Definitely! 

<Direction: to aide> 

Officer(John Cleese): Now then, how many of them have been injured? Oh God... 

Pither(Michael Palin): As I lay dwon to the sound of the Russian gentlemen practising their shooting, I realised I was in a bit of a pickle. My heart sank as I realised I should never see the Okehampton by-pass again... 

<Direction: Mix to Pither's sleeping face, waking up, shaking himself in disbelief at finding himself in a beautiful garden, with the sun shining, the birds singing. He is in a deckchair, and his mother, having poured him a jug of iced fruit juice, is gently nudging Pither to wake him.> 

Mother(Eric Idle): Come on, dear. Wake up dear. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Mother! 

Mother(Eric Idle): Come on dear. 

Pither(Michael Palin): So, it was all a dream. 

Mother(Eric Idle): No dear, 

Mother(None): this 

Mother(Eric Idle): is the dream, you're still in the cell. 

<Direction: Mix to Pither waking up in the cell. The officer enters carrying a rifle.> 

Officer(John Cleese): OK, we're going to have another try. I think we've got it now. My boys have been looking down the wrong bit, you see. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Oh no, look, you've got to look down the bit there. 

Officer(John Cleese): Oh I thought you had to look down that bit. 

Pither(Michael Palin): No, no, you've got to look down that bit, or you won't hit anything. 

Officer(John Cleese): Alright, we'll give it a whirl. Guards, seize him. 

<Direction: they take him out as he leaves> 

Officer(John Cleese): Listen. You've got to look down this bit. 

<Direction: As they leave, we can see on the wall of the cell a poster, saying: 'Saturday Night at the Moscow Praesidium, starring Eartha Kitt, with Burgess and Maclean. "A Song a Dance and a Piece of Treachery". Marshal Bulganin and "Charlie", Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Leningrad has never laughed so much.' Mix through to stock film of the Kremlin. Dubber over laughter and applause. A cheerful band sing. Mix through to stage where someone dressed as Marshall Bulganin, is standing with a little real ventriloquist's dummy. He gets up, takes his bow and walks off as the curtain swings down. Lots of applause and atmosphere. Terrible Russian compÃ¨re comes on smiling and applauding.> 

CompÃ¨re(Eric Idle): Osledi Osledi. 

<Direction: He tells a quick joke in Russian, and roars with laughter. Laughter from audience. He holds up his hands and then becomes very sincere, saying obviously deeply moving, wonderful things about the next guest, whom he finally introduces.> 

CompÃ¨re(Eric Idle): Eartha Kitt! 

<Direction: Gulliver comes on-stage in the full Eartha Kitt rig - white fur stole, slit skirt and jewellery. He mimes to the voice of Edward Heath. Trade Union leaders - I would say this - we've done our part. Now, on behalf of the community, we have a right to expect you, the Trade Union leaders, to do yours. etc. Unrest in the audience as they recognize him. They start shouting 'sing "Old-Fashioned Girl"' and throwing vegetables. Slow motion shot of a tomato hitting Gulliver. He is seen to be holding a turnip.> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): That turnip's certainly not safe. 

<Direction: looking round and seeing where he is> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Oh no! Mr Pither! Mr Pither! 

<Direction: He runs off-stage, pursued by the guards. Cut to the stage-door of the hall. A sign on the door says 'Next week Clodagh Rogers'. Gulliver out, and then through the streets, hotly pursued by soldiers and secret service men, firing after him. calling> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Mr Pither! Mr Pither! 

<Direction: He is seen running through a dockyard. Finally he stops by a high stone wall.> 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Mr Pither! 

Pither's Voice(Michael Palin): Here! 

<Direction: Gulliver looks round and then rapidly climbs up and over the wall. He drops down to find Pither standing on the other side.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Gulliver. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Pither! What a stroke of luck. 

Pither(Michael Palin): Well yes and no. 

<Direction: He indicates with his head. Cut to show that both of them are standing in front of a firing squad. The officer is heard as before. The squard runs towards them with fixed bayonets. CAPTION: 'SCENE MISSING' Cut to Cornish country lane. A road sign says 'Tavistock 12 miles'. Pither stands beneath with Gulliver and his bicycle.> 

Pither(Michael Palin): Phew, what an amazing escape. Well goodbye, Reginald. 

Gulliver(Terry Jones): Goodbye, Mr Pither, and good luck with the tour! 

<Direction: They shake hands. Gulliver strides off. Pither mounts his bike and rides off into the sunset. Music swells. Roll credits. Cut to a field with hedgerow behind. The first animated monster peeks over the hedge. Hey, I think he's finally gone! Second monster appears. Ooh yes! They hop over the fence into the field. Ready, Maurice? Right-ho, Kevin. Let's go. All right, maestro, hit it! We hear Clodagh Rogers singing 'Jack in a Box'. The two monsters jump up and down enthusiastically if not gracefully. Fade out. Fade up on two pilots in the cockpit of an aeroplane. A stewardess is there too. After a moment or two the first pilot makes an announcement.> 

First Pilot(Michael Palin): This is Captain MacPherson welcoming you aboard East Scottish Airways. You'll have had your tea. Our destination is Glasgow. There is no need to panic. 

<Direction: The door of the cockpit opens and Mr Badger comes in.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): There's a bomb on board this plane, and I'll tell you where it is for a thousand pounds. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): I don't believe you. 

Badger(Eric Idle): If you don't tell me where the bomb is... if I don't give you the money... Unless you give me the bomb... 

Stewardess(Carol Cleveland): The money. 

Badger(Eric Idle): The money, thank you, pretty lady... the bomb will explode killing everybody. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Including you. 

Badger(Eric Idle): I'll tell you where it is for a pound. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Here's a pound. 

Badger(Eric Idle): I don't want Scottish money. They've got the numbers. It can be traced. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): One English pound. Now where's the bomb? 

Badger(Eric Idle): I can't remember. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): You've forgotten. 

Badger(Eric Idle): Aye, you'd better have your pound back. Oh... 

<Direction: rubs it> 

Badger(Eric Idle): fingerprints. 

First Pilot(Michael Palin): Now where's the bomb? 

Badger(Eric Idle): Ah, wait a tic, wait a tic. 

<Direction: closes eyes and thinks opens eyes> 

Badger(Eric Idle): I'll tell you where the bomb is for a pound. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): It's in the luggage compartment. 

Badger(Eric Idle): Right. Here's your pound.. 

<Direction: Enter a man with headphones.> 

Headphones(Graham Chapman): Is this character giving you any trouble? 

First Pilot(Michael Palin): He's just ruined this sketch. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): Yes, absolutely. 

Headphones(Graham Chapman): Let's go on to the next one. 

Badger(Eric Idle): Wait a tic, wait a tic. No. I won't ruin your sketch for a pound. 

Second Pilot(John Cleese): No, no. 

Badger(Eric Idle): 75p. 

Headphones(Graham Chapman): Next item. 

<Direction: they start to leave The nude organist is seated at his organ in the open air, with a lovely scarlet dressing-gown draped round his shoulders. It says on it 'Noel Coward' which is crossed out and 'Nude Organist' written underneath. He is holding forth to a journalist with a notepad who is nodding and interviewing him. Someone else holds a small tape recorder. Make-up ladies are adding the finishing touches. They bring him a mirror while he talks. Someone is taking photos of him, perhaps with flashbulbs.> 

Nude Man(Terry Jones): Well I see my role in it as, er, how can I put it best - the nude man - as sort of symbolizing the two separate strands of existence, the essential nudity of man... 

<Direction: They realize that they are on camera. They remove the man's robe and clear the set. He grins at the camera and plays his chords. Cut to the announcer. He is sitting at his desk in the middle of a field but he is talking earnestly to a trendy girl reporter.> 

Announcer(John Cleese): It's an interesting question. Personally I rather adhere to the Bergsonian idea of laughter as a social sanction against inflexible behaviour but... excuse me a moment... And now... 

It's Man(Michael Palin): It's... 

<Direction: Animated titles. and CAPTION:> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): 'AND NOW THE TEN SECONDS OF SEX' 

<Direction: Black screen and the sound of a ticking clock for ten seconds.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): 'ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN STOP NOW' 

<Direction: Cut to a little palm court set. A man seated.> 

Man in Tails(Graham Chapman): Well, we'll be continuing with 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' in just a moment 

<Direction: consults his watch> 

Man in Tails(Graham Chapman): fr...o...m nnnnnnnnnnnn...now. 

<Direction: Cut to a building site. The camera pans over it.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): This new housing development in Bristol is one of the most interesting in the country. It's using a variety of new techniques: shock-proof curtain-walling, a central high voltage, self-generated electricity source, and extruded acrylic fiberglass fitments. It's also the first major housing project in Britain to be built entirely by characters from nineteenth-century English literature. 

<Direction: By, this time the pan has come to rest on a section of the site where various nineteenth-century literary figures are at work round a cement mixer: two ladies in crinolines, Bob Cratchett on his father's back, Heathcliff and Catherine throwing bricks to each other with smouldering passion, Nelson, Mr Beadle as foreman. Cut to the interior of a half-finished concrete shell. A little girl is working on top of a ladder.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Here Little Nell, from Dickens's 'Old Curiosity Shop' fits new nylon syphons into the asbestos-lined ceilings ... 

<Direction: shot of complicated electrical wiring in some impressive electrical installation cut to Arthur Huntingdon studying a plan; he has a builder's safety helmet on> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Arthur Huntingdon, who Helen Graham married as a young girl, and whose shameless conduct eventually drove her back to her brother Lawrence, in Anne BrontÃ«'s 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' describes why it's unique. 

Huntingdon(Eric Idle): Because sir, it is self-generating. Because we have harnessed here in this box the very forces of life itself. The very forces that will send Helen running back to beg forgiveness! 

<Direction: Cut to a close up of big pre-fabricated concrete slabs being hoisted into the air by a crane and start to pull out, as the commentator speaks, to reveal a crowd of nineteenth-centuty farmhands working on them.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): The on-site building techniques involve the construction of twelve-foot walling blocks by a crowd of farmhands from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' supervised by the genial landlady, Mrs Jupp, from Samuel Butler's 'Way of All Flesh'. 

<Direction: Pan to reveal Mrs Jupp with a clipboard. Cut to voice over narrator in vision with a stick-mike, in front of an impressive piece of motorway interchange building. Behind him and working on the site are six angels, three devils, and Adam and Eve.> 

Narrator(Michael Palin): In contrast to the site in Bristol, it's progress here on Britain's first eighteen-level motorway interchange being built by characters from Milton's 'Paradise Lost'... 

<Direction: He turns and we zoom past him into the angels etc. voice over> 

Narrator(Michael Palin): What went wrong here? 

<Direction: Cut to a foreman in a donkey jacket and helmet.> 

Foreman(Terry Jones): Well, no one really got on. Satan didn't get on with Eve ... er... Archangel Gabriel didn't get on with Satan... nobody got on with the Serpent, so now they have to work a rota: forces of good from ten till three, forces of evil three to six. 

<Direction: The camera tracks through a high-rise development area.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But even more modern building techniques are being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in under a minute. 

<Direction: Mystico removes his cloak, gloves and top hat and hands them to Janet, who curtsies. He then makes several passes. Cut to stock film of flats falling down reversed so that they leap up. Cut back to Mystico and Janet. She hands him back his things as they make their way to their car, a little Austin 30.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): The local Council here have over fifty hypnosis-induced twenty-five story blocks, put up by El Mystico and Janet. I asked Mr Ken Verybigliar the advantages of hypnosis compared to other building methods. 

<Direction: Cut to a man in a drab suit. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR K. V. B. LIAR'> 

Mr Verybigliar(Michael Palin): Well there is a considerable financial advantage in using the services of El Mystico. A block, like Mystico Point here, 

<Direction: indicating a high-rise block behind him> 

Mr Verybigliar(Michael Palin): would normally cost in the region of one-and-a-half million pounds. This was put up for five pounds and thirty bob for Janet. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But the obvious question is are they safe? 

<Direction: Cut to an architect's office. The architect at his desk. Behind him on the wall are framed photos of various collapsed buildings. He is a well-dressed authoritative person. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR CLEMENT ONAN, ARCHITECT TO THE COUNCIL'> 

Architect(Graham Chapman): Of course they're safe. There's absolutely no doubt about that. They are as strong, solid and as safe as any other building method in this country provided of course people believe in them. 

<Direction: Cut to a council flat. On the wall there is a picture of Mystico.> 

Tenant(Eric Idle): Yes, we received a note from the Council saying that if we ceased to believe in this building it would fall down. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): You don't mind living in a figment of another man's imagination? 

Tenant(Eric Idle): No, it's much better than where we used to live. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Where did you used to live? 

Tenant(Eric Idle): We had an eighteen-roomed villa overlooking Nice. 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Really, that sounds much better. 

Tenant(Eric Idle): Oh yes - yes you're right. 

<Direction: Cut to stock shot of block falling down in slow motion. Cut back to tenant and wife inside. Camera shaking and on the tilt.> 

Tenant(Eric Idle): No, no, no, of course not. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film again. The building rights itself. Cut back to interior again. Camera slightly on tilt. They are holding bits of crockery etc.> 

Tenant(Eric Idle): Phew, that was close. 

<Direction: Cut to tracking shot from back of camera car again. This time El Mystico striding through the towering blocks, his cloak swirling behind him.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But the construction of these vast new housing developments, providing homes for many thousands of people, is not the only project to which he has applied his many talents. He also has an Infallible Pools Method, a School of Spanish Dancing and a Car Hire Service. 

<Direction: cut to Mystico at wheel of his little Austin 30, his amazing eyes riveted on the road ahead; Janet occasiona1ly tactfully guides the steering wheel the camera pans over on to Janet and starts to zoom in on her as she watches the road ahead; cut to a nineteenth-century engraving of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra cut to picture of Napoleon and Josephine cut to Janet lying on a bed in a negligie in a rather seedy hotel> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): So Mystico has his Janet. 

<Direction: Mystico leaps from top of the wardrobe on to the bed with a lusty yell. Cut to montage of black and white photos of Janet in various stage poses: three poses against black drapes; one against a building; one posed outside a terrace house with notice reading 'School of Spanish Dancing - Dentures Repaired'.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Yes. Janet ... a quiet, shy girl. An honours graduate from Harvard University, American junior sprint record holder, ex-world skating champion, Nobel Prize winner, architect, novelist and surgeon. The girl who helped crack the Oppenheimer spy ring in 1947. She gave vital evidence to the Senate Narcotics Commission in 1958. She also helped to convict the woman at the chemist's in 1961, and a year later

<Direction: Cut to Superintendent Harry 'Boot-in' Swalk'> 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SUPERINTENDENT HARRY "BOOT-IN" SWALK' 

Swalk(Terry Jones): We admit that there have been outbreaks of hanging recently, but the police are trying to keep the situatuon under control. 

<Direction: his personal two-way radio is making rather a noise claps his hand over the radio to little avail> 

Swalk(Terry Jones): Electrocutions are another big worry. But we hope that guillotining has been eradicated from the urban areas. and garrotting is confined almost entirely to Luton. So if you have a friend in prison or under the sentence of death, be sure to let us know at this address. 

<Direction: and CAPTION:> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): 'THE POLICE FORCE, "SUNNYVIEW", YEOVIL, SOMERSET' 

<Direction: Cut to a mortuary. Various trolleys lie about with corpses covered by sheets. Two workers are sitting at a low make-shift table with cups of tea and a transistor radio, shelling eggs and dropping them in a pickling jar.> 

First Radio Voice(John Cleese): ... and Premier Chou En Lai, who called it 'a major breakthrough'. Twelve men were accidentally hanged at Whitby Assizes this afternoon whilst considering their verdict. This is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in Britain since Tuesday. 

<Direction: music> 

DJ Voice(Eric Idle): Well it's thirteen minutes to the hour of nine-nine-nine, here on wonderful Radio One-One-One! So if you're still lying in your big big bed, now is the time to get up out of it! We've got another thirteen hours of tip-top sounds here on Wonderful Radio One! 

<Direction: brief funny noises> 

DJ Voice(Eric Idle): Sorry about that ... So unless you have brain cells, or have completed the process of evolution, there's a wonderful day ahead! 

<Direction: switching the radio off he gets another radio out from underneath the table he gets another radio out he opens the top of the third radio and gets out a fourth; he switches it on> 

Second Radio Voice(Graham Chapman): It's 9 o'clock and time for 'Mortuary Hour'. An hour of talks, tunes and downright tomfoolery for all those who work in mortuaries, introduced as usual by Shirley Bassey. 

<Direction: sinister chords> 

Second Radio Voice(Graham Chapman): . 

Shirley(Carol Cleveland): Well, we're going to kick straight off this week with our Mortuary Quiz, so have your pens and pencils ready. 

<Direction: A door at the back of the mortuary opens and Mr Wang, an official of the Department of Stiffs, enters. He wears an undertaker's suit and top hat plus a long blond wig.> 

Wang(John Cleese): Turn that radio off and look lively! 

Battersby(Terry Jones): Oh, it's 'Mortuary Quiz', Mr Wang... 

Wang(John Cleese): Don't argue, Battersby. 

<Direction: We hear voices off. Officials at the door spring to attention. Enter a mayor with a chain round his neck, and an elderly peer of the realm who is standing on a small platform, pushed by an attendant.> 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): ... This is our mortuary in here, Your Grace ... 

Peer(Michael Palin): I see, I see, I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... I can't think of anything to say about it. 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): Well, we're very proud of it here, sir. It's one of the most up to date in the country. 

Peer(Michael Palin): I see... yes... yes ... now... um... what... what... ah... ah... what is it? .... is it a power station? 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): No, Your Grace, it's a mortuary. 

Peer(Michael Palin): I see ... I see ... good ... good ... good, good, good... 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): But it has one of the most advanced thermostat control systems in the country, and it has computer-controlled storage facilities. 

Peer(Michael Palin): I see, I see ... I ... er... er... er... er ... I ... er ... I'm a good little doggie. 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry, Your Grace? 

Peer(Michael Palin): I'm a good little dog. 

Attendant(Carol Cleveland): Oh dear... 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): Perhaps we should postpone the visit? 

Attendant(Carol Cleveland): No, no, no - you see it's just that his brain is so tiny that the slightest movement can dislodge it 

<Direction: starts to slap the duke's head from side to side gently but firmly> 

Attendant(Carol Cleveland): Your Grace ... Oh dear... it's rather like one of those games you play where you have to get the ball into the hole ... That's it. 

Peer(Michael Palin): Ah! Now then, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. Now then ... ah ... what happens when the steel is poured into the ingots? 

<Direction: ushering everyone out> 

Mayor(Graham Chapman): Perhaps we should go and have a look at the new showers? 

Peer(Michael Palin): Yes... yes ... yes ... yes... yes rather jolly good... jolly good .. jolly good ... jolly good ... no fear... 

<Direction: They leave. Battersby turns the radio on again.> 

Radio Voice(Carol Cleveland): Well the answers were as follows: 1) the left hand, 2) no, 3) normal, 4) yes it has, in 1963 when a bird got caught in the mechanism. How did you get on? 

<Direction: Two men behind him push in a trolley with sheet-covered corpses on it.> 

Wang(John Cleese): Turn that thing off! 

Battersby(Terry Jones): Oh! It's 'Mortuary Dance Time', Mr Wang! 

Wang(John Cleese): Never mind that, Battersby, this is the big one. I've just had Whitby Police on the phone with twelve hangees... 

Battersby(Terry Jones): Oh yes, I just heard about that on the radios ... 

Wang(John Cleese): No, these are twelve different ones ... so shtoom. 

<Direction: Battersby and friend gather round the body. Wang joins them. They start to work away busily and eficiently on the corpse. We suddenly become aware that Badger is standing with them around the body.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): I'll not interrupt this sketch for a pound. 

Wang(John Cleese): What? 

Badger(Eric Idle): For one pound I'll leave this sketch totally uninterrupted. 

Badger(Eric Idle): Fifty pence ... I'm prepared to negotiate a forty-pence deal. 

<Direction: an eye peers out from under the sheet on the corpse they are working on> 

Badger(Eric Idle): For 35p I won't interrupt any of the next three items. 

<Direction: The corpse is now sitting up waiting to see what happens. Another corpse sits up as they continue arguing. The sheet is pushed back on another trolley revealing a boy and girl on the same stretcher. They light cigarettes.> 

Wang(John Cleese): No, no, it's no good... 

Badger(Eric Idle): 25p. 

Wang(John Cleese): No. 

Badger(Eric Idle): 10p and a kiss. 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: with Gilliam's hands in shot. voice over Gilliam's head appears briefly> 

Terry Gilliam(Terry Gilliam): Sorry.

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'FINAL OF THE HIDE-AND-SEEK SECOND LEG' 

<Direction: Zoom in on commentator and the two finalists, forty-year-old men limbering up in shorts and singlets.> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): Hello, good afternoon and welcome to the second leg of the Olympic final of the men's Hide-and-Seek here in the heart of Britain's London. We'll be starting in just a couple of moments from now, and there you can see the two competitors Francisco Huron the Paraguayan, who in this leg is the seeker 

<Direction: we see Francisco Huron darting about, looking behind things we see Don Roberts practising hiding> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): our own Don Roberts from Hinckley in Leicestershire who, his trainer tells me, is at the height of his self-secreting form. And now in the first leg, which ended on Wednesday, Don succeeded in finding the Paraguayan in the new world record time of 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27.4 seconds, in a sweetshop in Kilmarnock. And now they're under starter's orders. 

<Direction: We see Don Roberts and Francisco Huron standing side by side, poised, looking nervous. voice over On your marks... get set... The starter fires his pistol. Francisco Huron immediately puts his hands over eyes and starts counting.> 

Francisco(Terry Jones): Uno, dos, tres, quattro, cinque, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez ... 

<Direction: Meanwhile Don Roberts hails a cab. He gets in and it drives off.> 

Francisco(Terry Jones): ... trientay dos, trientay tres, trientay quattro... 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '32, 33, 34' 

Commentator(Eric Idle): Well Don's off to a really great start there. Remember the Paraguayan has got 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours... 

<Direction: cut to taxi on the way to London airport> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): 3 minutes, 27.4 seconds to beat. 

<Direction: Cut back to Francisco still counting. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '998, 999, 1000'> 

Francisco(Terry Jones): Neuvecian no nuevetay ocho, nuevecientas nuevente ye nueve, mil. 

<Direction: Francisco takes his hands from his eyes and shouts> 

Francisco(Terry Jones): Coming! 

<Direction: He starts looking around the immediate locality suspiciously. We see a plane landing. There is a sign saying 'Benvenuto a Sardinia'. Cut to Don on a bicycle. Then running up a hill. Then going into castle. Running along corridors and eventualy pausing, looking around agitatedly, and then hiding behind a pillar. Occasionally he looks out nervously. Then cut to Francisco looking in shops in the Tottenham Court Road. Cut to studio 'Sportsview' desk with a Frank Bough man at it.> 

Frank Bough(Michael Palin): Well, we'll be taking you back there as soon as there are any developments. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'SIX YEARS LATER' 

<Direction: Cut back to desk. Frank Bough looks older.> 

Frank Bough(Michael Palin): We've just heard that something is happening in the Hide-and-Seek final, so let's go straight over there. 

<Direction: Cut to film of Francisco Huron. He is wandering around looking for Don Roberts in a beach setting. The commentator is some way from him. He speaks quietly into a microphone.> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): Hello again, and welcome to Madagascar, where Francisco Huron is seeking Don Roberts. And I've just been told that he has been told that he has been unofficially described as 'cold'. Ah, wait a minute. 

<Direction: in the distance Francisco Huron consults with an official; the commentator moves out of shot briefly, then returns> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): I've just been told that Huron has requested a plane ticket for Budapest! So he's definitely getting warmer. So we'll be back again in just a few years. 

<Direction: Cut to Frank Bough looking older. He is covered with cobwebs.> 

Frank Bough(Michael Palin): Really beginning to hot up now. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'FIVE YEARS, TWO MONTBS AND TWENTY-SIX DAYS LATER' 

<Direction: Cut to a Portuguese-looking setting. Francisco Huron looking round desperately and glancing at his watch.> 

Commentator(Eric Idle): So here we are on the very last day of this fantastic final. Huron now has less than twelve hours left to find British ace Don Roberts. Early this morning he finished combing the outskirts of Lisbon and now he seems to have staked everything on one final desperate seek here in the Tagus valley. But Roberts is over fifteen hundred miles away, and it's beginning to look all over, bar the shouting. The sands of time are running out for this delving dago, this savior of seek, perspicacious Paraguayan. He's still desperately cold and it's beginning to look like another gold for Britain. 

<Direction: The camera shows Huron creeping up on a dustbin. He pauses, snatches off the lid and looks inside. He turns away disappointed then does double take and looks back into the bin. He pulls out a sardine tin with the word 'Sardines' very obvious. Shot of Huron's reaction as he suddenly gets a tremendous idea. He snaps his fingers and hails a taxi and gets in. Cut to plane landing. Same sign as before 'Benvenuto a Sardinia'. Francisco cycles past. Cut to him discarding the bike and running up the hill straight into the castle. He runs along corridors into the right room, up to the pillar and finds Don Roberts skulking behind. They both look very tense as they await the official result, then react in fury and frustration when it is announced by a blazered offical.> 

Official(Michael Palin): The official result of the World Hide-and-Seek, Mr Don Roberts from Hinckley, Leicestershire, 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. Mr Francisco Huron, Paraguay, 11 years, a months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. The result - a tie. 

Voice Over(John Cleese): A tie! Well what a fantastic result. Well the replay will start tomorrow at 7.30 a.m. 

<Direction: As they stand there the camera pans off them to a window and then zooms through the window to reveal a beach where there is a Redcoat.> 

Redcoat(Michael Palin): Well hello again .... nice to be back ... glad to see the series has been doing well. Well now, sorry about Mon-trerx. 

<Direction: At this point two men run past in the background carrying a donkey. A third runs behind carrying a sign saying 'Donkey Rides' and winking and pointing at the donkey, they run out of picture.> 

Redcoat(Michael Palin): That was a little item entitled Hide-and-Seek - very anarchic, very effective, not quite my cup of tea, but very nice for the younger people. Well, the next item the boys have put together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting room, but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly expensive production of 'Clochmerle'... 

<Direction: He is hit by Mr Robinson with a chicken. Robinson walks away and we follow him as he passes Badger in the foreground.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): This is a totally free interruption and no money has exchanged hands whatever. 

<Direction: The camera doesn't pause at all on Badger and we continue panning with Robinson until he reaches the knight in amour. He hands the chicken to the knight. He walks away from knight and into the distance. Mix through to a modern sitting room. Mrs Robinson is eating alone at the table looking at the clock.> 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Sorry about that, darling... 

<Direction: he sits She serves him some vegetables. He unfolds his napkin.> 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): Gravy? 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Yes please, dear. 

<Direction: They sit and eat in silence. Suddenly the doorbell rings.> 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): Oh dear, that'll be the Cheap-Laughs from next door. 

<Direction: Various different doorbell sounds and chimes. Mr Robinson goes to the front door, and opens it. Standing outside are Mr and Mrs Cheap-Laugh. He is wearing a big floppy comedian's suit and a big bow tie and fright wig. She is a Mrs Equator sort of lady, with an enormous hairstyle, and dressed in very bad taste.> 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Come in. 

Mr Cheap-Laugh(Terry Jones): No! Just breathing heavily! 

<Direction: He and his wife roar with laughter. As he comes in he slips and falls on the mat. His wife puts a custard pie in his face. More roars of laughter.> 

Mrs Cheap-Laugh(Graham Chapman): Oh we just dropped in. 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Would you like to come through... 

<Direction: We mix through to the exterior of a house at night. Shrieks of laughter, crushes of crockery. The two men with the donkey run past in road, the third man behind pointing to the sign. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'ONE EVENING WITH THE CHEAP-LAUGHS LATER' The light comes on in hall. Cut to them in the hall at the front door.> 

Mr Cheap-Laugh(Terry Jones): Well goodnight and give us a kiss. 

<Direction: kisses Mrs Robinson> 

Mrs Cheap-Laugh(Graham Chapman): Oh thank you very much for a very nice evening. 

Mr Cheap-Laugh(Terry Jones): After you, dear. 

<Direction: He trips her up and she falls out into the darkness. We hear her shriek with laughter. Mr Cheap-Laugh drops his trousers, makes lavatory chain pulling sign and noise and hurls himself out after wife and disappears into the darkness. More laughter. The host shuts the door. They heave a sigh of relief and go back into the sitting room. The crockery on the table is all smashed in a heap on the floor with the table cloth. The standard lamp is broken in half. There are large splodges of food and wine splashes on the walls. Some glasses and a moustache are drawn on the Tretchikoff picture of the Chinese girl. Mrs Robinson flops down on the sofa. There is a farting cushion. She removes it, irritated.> 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): Oh honestly dear, why do we always have to buy everything just because the Cheap-Laughs have one? 

<Direction: He goes over to the wall cupboard for drinks. A bucket of whitewash is balanced on the half-open door. He opens the cupboard and the bucket of whitewash falls on him. Cut briefly to Mr Badger.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): This is not an interruption at all. 

<Direction: Cut back to Mr Robinson. He pours himself a drink, without reacting to the whitewash.> 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): It's just neighbourliness dear, that's all... 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): I think we should try and lead our own lives from now on. 

<Direction: She opens a sewing box and a boxing glove on a spring comes out and hits her on the chin.> 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Can't you be serious for one moment? 

<Direction: He sits on the pouffe. The sixteen-ton weight falls on him. Cut to the exterior of the house. The lights go off downstairs and upstairs. The two men run past carrying a pantomime goose. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LATER THAT NIGHT' Cut to a darkened bedroom. Mr and Mrs Robinson are in a double bed, talking.> 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): I'm sorry I was cross earlier. 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): Oh that's all right, dear. It's just that I get so sick of always having to be like the Cheap-Laughs. 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Well yes, from now on we'll be like ourselves. 

Mrs Robinson(Carol Cleveland): Oh Roger... 

Mr Robinson(John Cleese): Oh Beatrice. 

<Direction: The bed springs up and folds into the back wall of the bedroom. On the underneath of the bed is a presenter on a chair. The underneath of the bed also consists of a flat as for current affairs-type programme, with 'Probe' written above narrator.> 

Presenter(Eric Idle): Many people in this country are becoming increasingly worried about bull-fighting. They say it's not only cruel, vicious and immoral, but also blatantly unfair. The bull is heavy, violent, abusive and aggressive with four legs and great sharp teeth, whereas the bull-fighter is only a small, greasy Spaniard. Given this basic inequality what can be done to make bull-fighting safer? We asked Brigadier Arthur Farquar-Smith, Chairman of the British Well-Basically Club. 

<Direction: Cut to a brigadier.> 

Brigadier(John Cleese): Well, basically it's quite apparent that these little dago chappies have got it all wrong. They prance round the bull like a lot of bally night club dancers looking like the Younger Generation or a less smooth version of the Lionel Blair Troupe, 

<Direction: getting rather camp a huge hammer strikes him on the head; he becomes butch again getting camp the hammer strikes him on the head again the lights go off> 

Brigadier(John Cleese): What? ... oh... 

<Direction: voice over> 

Badger(Eric Idle): I'll put the lights on again for a pound. 

<Direction: Cut to an animated sketch, and then to a strange moonlike landscape. Eerie science-fiction music plays in the background.> 

Voice Over(John Cleese): This is the planet Algon, fifth world in the system of Aldebaran, the Red Giant in the constellation of Sagittarius. Here an ordinary cup of drinking chocolate costs four million pounds, an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs over six billion pounds, and a pair of split-crotch panties would be almost unobtainable. 

<Direction: cut to a budget-day-type graphic, with a picture of the product and the price alongside picture of electric kettle graphic of American GNP graphic of an electric kettle showing all the separate pieces detatched from each other, arrow points to the fixing ring Cut to James M'Burke sitting at a desk. 'Algon I' motifs everywhere. Another expert stands by a model of the planet, and there is a panel of experts at a long desk who are all obviously dummies. Everyone has one of those single earphones.> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Well, our computers have been working all day to analyse the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever intergalactic probe, Algon I ... 

<Direction: suddenly very excited as he hears something over his earphone very, indistinct pictures start to come through on the screen behind him> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): But we're now getting some live pictures through from Algon! Harry - Perhaps you could talk us through them. 

<Direction: Cut into pictures from Algon. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM ALGON' Very fuzzy pictures of the Algon landscape. Panning and tracking shots hand held. voice over> 

Harry(Terry Jones): Very little evidence of shopping facilities here .. there don't seem to be any large supermarkets. There may be some on-the-corner grocery stores behind those rocks, but it's difficult to tell from this angle. It does seem to suggest that most of the shopping here is by direct mail. 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'DIGESTIVE BISCUITS; Â£8,OOO,OOO PER PACKET' 

<Direction: Cut to James M'Burke.> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Of course the big question that everyone's asking here is, what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself? Professor? 

<Direction: Cut to a professor sitting beside a contour model of an area of Algon. It has a little model of the probe marking where it has landed. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'PROFESSOR HERMAN KHAN, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF SPLIT-CROTCH PANTIES'> 

Professor(Eric Idle): We must remember that Algon is over 75,000 miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles around the probe. Split-crotch panties, or indeed any items of what we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be much more plentiful on other parts of the planet. 

<Direction: Camera pans to include M'Burke.> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Professor, you were responsible for finding Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear become even naughtier? 

Professor(Eric Idle): Oh naughtier and naughtier. 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'NO BANANAS ON ALGON' 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Well so much for that ... But of course, the probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination of elastic-sided boots and tights. 

<Direction: He produces the bottom half of a tailor's dummy wearing boots and tights with panties over the tights halfway down. On the screen behind, more dim indecipherable TV pictures from Algon.> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): But I think we're getting some pictures now from Algon itself, and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good too! Professor? 

Professor(Eric Idle): Ja - she's a real honey! 

<Direction: All we see on the screen is a blurred female figure.> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon... 

<Direction: the screen goes blank> 

M'Burke(Michael Palin): Hoy! Look! Oh dear, I'm sorry we've lost contact. We'll try and re-establish contact with Algon... 

<Direction: Cut to presenter's-type chair. Mr Badger appears at side of screen.> 

Badger(Eric Idle): Hello... The BBC have offered me the sum of forty pence to read the credits of this show. 

<Direction: sits the signature tune is heard> 

Badger(Eric Idle): Also appearing were Carol Cleveland, Marie Anderson, Mrs Idle, Make-up - Madelaine Gaffney, Costume - Hazel Pethig, Animations by Terry Gilliam, Visual Effects Designer - Bernard Wilkie, Graphics - Bob Blagden, Film Cameraman - Alan Featherstone, Film Editor - Ray Millichope, Sound - Richard Chubb, Lighting - Bill Bailey, Designer - Bob Berk, Produced by Ian MacNaughton for 92p and a bottle of Bells whisky ... it was a BBC colour production. That's just it. I'd like to say if there are any BBC producers looking in who need people to read the credits for them, I would personally... 

<Direction: The camera pulls out to reveal the sixteen-ton weight poised above him. As the picture fades the weight falls on him. Outside a shop. A sign reads 'Tuder Job Agency - Jobs a Speciality'. A man enters the shop. Inside it is decorated in Tudor style. The assistant is in Tudor dress.> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Morning, sir, can I help you? 

Customer(Graham Chapman): Yes, yes... I wondered if you have any part-time vacancies on your books. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Part-time, I'll have a look, sir. 

<Direction: he gets out a book and looks through it> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Let me look now. We've got, ah yes, Sir Walter Raleigh is equipping another expedition to Virginia; he needs traders and sailors. Vittlers needed at the Court of Philip of Spain, oh, yes, and they want master joiners and craftsmen for the building of the Globe Theatre. 

Customer(Graham Chapman): I see. Have you anything a bit more modern, you know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs. 

Customer(Graham Chapman): That can't be very profitable, can it? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up the Northwest passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with the Holy Roman Empire is going... no, quite right, it's no good at all. 

Customer(Graham Chapman): What? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): It's a dead loss. We haven't put anyone in a job since 1625. 

Customer(Graham Chapman): I see. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): That's all? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): That's all you say? 

Customer(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp. Then came James the First and the bottom fell out of the Tudor jobs. 1603 - 800 vacancies filled, 1604 - 40, 1605 - none, 1606 - none. The rest of the Stuart period nothing. Hanoverians nothing. Victorians nothing. Saxe-Coburgs nothing. Windsors... what did you want? 

Customer(Graham Chapman): Dirty books, please. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Right. 

<Direction: produces selection of mags from under counter> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Sorry about the Tudor bit, but you can't be too careful, you know. Have a look through these. 

Customer(Graham Chapman): Have you got anything a bit... er... 

Assistant(Terry Jones): A bit stronger? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Hold on ... a... My Lord of Warwick! 

<Direction: off> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): 'Allo! 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Right. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Can't be too careful you know, sir. 

<Direction: The wall of the Tudor shop slides back to reveal the interior of a Soho dirty bookshop in the back room - a bare room with a counter and magazines in racks on the walls at eye-level. Three drably dressed men are thumbing through books. One of them is a vicar, one of them is gathering a huge pile. Behind the counter is a Soho toughie in Tudor gear showing books to Mr Nid - a tweedy, rather academic, respectable-looking man of senior years. The customer goes through, and the wall slides back.> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): There's a 'Bridget - Queen of the Whip'. 

Nid(John Cleese): Yes... 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Or 'Naughty Nora'... or there's this one: 'Doug, Bob and Gordon Visit the 

Second Assistant(None): Ark Royal 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): '. Or there's 'Sister Teresa - The Spanking Nun'. 

Nid(John Cleese): Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially about Devon and Cornwall? 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): No. I'm afraid not, sir. 

Nid(John Cleese): The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 'Devonshire Country Churches'. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Well how about this, sir: 'Bum Biters'. 

Nid(John Cleese): No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any general surveys of English Church architecture? 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): No, it's not really our line, sir. 

Nid(John Cleese): No, I see. Well, never mind I'll just take the 'Lord Lieutenant in Nylons' then, and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. Thank you. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Right, sir. 

<Direction: voice over> 

First Assistant(Terry Jones): My Lord of Warwick. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): 'Allo? 

First Assistant(Terry Jones): Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach! 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Right.

Man(Terry Gilliam): Just these, then. 

<Direction: Enter Gaskell in Tudor gear. The wall closes up behind him.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): All right. This is a raid. My name is Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Ah! Sir Philip Sidney. 'Tis good to see thee on these shores again. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Shut up. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Your suit is fair and goodly cut. Was't from Antwerp? 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the smutty books, Maddox. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Sir Philip!. Prithee nay! 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Listen, mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox. 

<Direction: They all look at him blankly. He looks to Maddox for support and realizes he isn't there.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Maddox! Where's he gone? 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Sir Philip, prithee rest awhile. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you, I'm not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell and this is a raid. 

<Direction: Everybody resumes their book-buying and ignores him. At the counter the assistant is still totting up the huge pile of books.> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): That'll be 540 quid sir. 

Man(Terry Gilliam): Oh, I'll just have this one then. 

<Direction: takes top one> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Maddox! 

<Direction: addressing everyone in shop; they ignore him no reaction people start to leave through the rear door of the shop; Gaskell blocks it> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Where are you going? 

Customer(Graham Chapman): I'm going home. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Right. 

<Direction: looks for his notebook but it's not in his Tudor clothing> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): I'll remember you. Don't you worry. I'll remember you... 

Customer(Graham Chapman): Pray good, Sir Philip, that you... 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Don't you start! Maddox! 

<Direction: the customer leaves; other customers start to leave the vicar comes up to counter the vicar leaves guiltily> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Farewell, good Sir Philip. 

<Direction: He goes out carrying a pile of magazines. Then the vicar goes, followed by the Tudor man.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Hey, stop! 

<Direction: the door slams; Gaskell turns and looks round the empty shop; pause He rushes up to the sliding wall and beats on it. Then he turns and makes for the little back door and goes through.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): You'll never get away with this, you porn merchant. Blimey! 

<Direction: He stops and gapes. We cut to his eye-line to see he is standing in a beautiful, green, Tudor garden. In the distance a Tudor house. A girl is sitting on a stone bench, sobbing. Gaskell walks towards her, bewildered. The girl looks up at him with beseeching eyes. She is young and beautiful. Oh good sir, how glad I am to see thee come. Forgive me weeping, but my love has gone.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Er, listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We are not Tudor people. We are the police. 

<Direction: An Elizabethan gentleman appears through the trees.> 

Father(Terry Jones): Frances, what idleness is this? Why, good Sir Philip Sidney, 

<Direction: he bows extravagantly to Gaskell> 

Father(Terry Jones): What hast thee here? 

<Direction: turning to Caskell with bated breath You are Sir Philip Sidney?> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): ... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent Gaskell of the Vice Squad. 

Father(Terry Jones): Ah good, Sir Philip, thy sharp-tongued wit has not deserted thee. Come. Let us eat and drink. Stay with us awhile. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): All right, sir. I think I will. 

<Direction: They walk off together arm in arm into the idyllic country garden. The girl looks after them with hope in her eyes. Bring up Elizabethan music. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE LIFE OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY' Mix through to a Tudor dining room. At the table a group of Tudor gentry are sitting listening to Gaskell. Evidence of a banquet, and two minstrels in attendance. Gaskell has obviously just finished a story. Applause and laughter.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): . .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing doing five years bird in Parkhurst. 

<Direction: Applause. They are all very impressed. Cut to exterior. A messenger on a horse rides full pelt straight towards the camera. It is dusk. He stops outside the Elizabethan house, leaps off and dashes into the house. Cut to interior again. They are still all laughing from his last story. The messenger bursts into room.> 

Messenger(Terry Gilliam): Sir Philip. The Spaniards have landed in the Netherlands. My Lord Walsingham needs you there forthwith. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Let's go. 

<Direction: Cut to exterior. Gaskell is seated on the back of the messenger's horse and they gallop off. The dinner crowd are standing waving on the doorstep. Good luck, Sir Philip! Cut to a British standard fluttering in the breeze against the blue sky. Fanfare. Two Elizabethan gentlemen, and four men dressed as Elizabethan soldiers are standing on a cliff top. Gaskell strides up to them, and takes up position on topmost point of the knoll.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Where are the Spaniards? 

Elizabethan Gent(Eric Idle): Down below Sir Philip, their first boats are landing even now. 

<Direction: Shot of a sailing-galley seen from above.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Right, you stay here, I'll go and get them. 

Elizabethan Gent(Eric Idle): Sir Philip! Not alone! 

<Direction: Cut to the beach. Suspense music. Gaskell strides up to the camera, until he is towering over it. The music reaches crescendo.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Allo allo! What's going on here? 

<Direction: Cut to beached rowing boat piled high with bundles of dirty magazines. Two Spaniards are unloading it.> 

Spaniard(Terry Jones): Ees nothing, SeÃ±or, ees just some literature. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): I know what literature is, you dago dustbin. I also know what porn is. 

<Direction: pulls out a loose magazine and brandishes it> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): What's this then eh? 

Spaniard(Terry Jones): It is one of Lope De Vega's latest play, SeÃ±or. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): 'Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that? 

Spaniard(Terry Jones): It's very visual, SeÃ±or. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth. 

Spaniard(Terry Jones): Oh, but SeÃ±or. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these baskets of filth and come with me. 

<Direction: The second Spaniard leaps out of the boat with a drawn sword and they both engage Gaskell in a fight. Then we start to draw away from them, leaving them tiny dots in the distance fighting. Fight music over all this and voice over.> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): The battle raged long and hard, but as night fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums' and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day. The tide of Spanish porn was stemmed. Sir Philip Sidney returned to London in triumph. 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of Elizabethan London street during celebrations. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LONDON 1583' Cut to side on close up of Gaskell riding hard through woodland.>

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Good evening all, my love. I have returned safe from the Low Countries. 

<Direction: she hurriedly hides the book she is reading under some knitting and starts whistling>

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Oh ...'Gay Boys in Bondage' What, is't - tragedy? Comedy? 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): 'Tis a... er... 'tis a story of a man's great love for his... fellow men. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet on these shores. 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Indeed. How was the war, my lord? 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen chests of hardcore captured. 

<Direction: trying to look innocent> 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Hast brought home any spoils of war? 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Yes, good my wife, this fair coat trimmed with ermine. 

<Direction: without enthusiasm> 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Oh, lovely, nowt else? 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): No, no fair lady. The rest was too smutty. 

<Direction: He settles himself down in front of his lady's feet and the fire.> 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Now, my good wife. Whilst I rest, read to me a while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'. 

<Direction: The wife looks a trifle taken aback but reluctantly opens the book and starts to read with a resigned air.> 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Yes... my lord ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' ... Ken, 25, is a mounted policeman with a difference... and what a difference. Even Roger is surprised and he's... 

<Direction: she looks slightly, sick with guilt> 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): he's used to real men ...

Wife(Carol Cleveland): 'But who's going to do the cooking tonight? Roddy's got a mouthful...' 

<Direction: Enter Maddox - a modern-day plain-clothed policeman.> 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): All right, this is a raid. 

<Direction: The wife screams, Gaskell leaps to his feet.> 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Oh! We are disgraced! 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): There you are, Maddox! 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): Cut the chat... and get in the van. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Maddox! You recognize me... 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): Indeed I do, Sir Philip Sidney, and sad I am to see you caught up in this morass of filth, 

<Direction: he picks up the book> 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): ooh - that's a long one. 

Wife(Carol Cleveland): Oh oh... the glorious name of Sidney is besmirched ... all is lost ... oh alas the day. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate Sergeant Maddox... 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): You'll do time for this. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell. 

Maddox(Graham Chapman): Come on Sidney.

Maddox(Graham Chapman): And you, miss. 

Gaskell(Michael Palin): I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop...

He(John Cleese): We must be getting on. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you ...

Vicar(Michael Palin): It always happens ... whenever I've found someone I really think I'm going to be able to get on with... 

He(John Cleese): No, the only thing is, you see, we're going to be a little bit late.

Thripshaw(John Cleese): What? 

Burrows(Michael Palin): I'm up to here with it, I'm sick to death. I can't take you any longer so I've come to see it.

Burrows(Michael Palin): This is my problem with words. Oh, that seems to have cleared it. 'Oh I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee'. Yes, that seems to be all right. Thank you very much. 

Thripshaw(John Cleese): I see. But recently you have been having this problem with your word order. 

Burrows(Michael Palin): Well, absolutely, and what makes it worse, sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong fusebox. 

Thripshaw(John Cleese): Fusebox? 

Burrows(Michael Palin): And the thing about saying the wrong word is a) I don't notice it, and b) sometimes orange water given bucket of plaster.

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well, if you're having some, yes then, perhaps, vicar. 

<Direction: slightly taken aback> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Oh... well there's only just enough for me. 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well in that case I won't, don't worry. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): You see, if I split what's left, there'd be hardly any left for me at all. 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well, I'm not a great sherry drinker. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Good! So, I can have it all ... now then what's the problem? 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well, just recently I've begun to worry about... 

<Direction: The vicar has been looking through his desk. He produces a bottle of sherry in triumph.> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Ah! I've found another bottle! You can have some now if you want to.

Vicar(Michael Palin): No, no ... no do stay here. Have a sherry... you won't be long will you, Husband? 

Husband(Eric Idle): Oh no, vicar... it's just a question of signing a few forms. 

<Direction: The vicar pours Husband a sherry.> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): There we are... there we are, Mr Husband. Now, how about you, Mr Kirkham? 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well only if there's enough. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Oh well, there's not much now. 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Oh, in that case... no... I won't bother. 

<Direction: pouring himself one> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Good. Right... now, then, what is the problem, Husband? 

Husband(Eric Idle): Well, vicar, I've made enquiries with our shippers and the most sherry they can ship in any one load is 12,000 gallons. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): And how many glasses is that? 

Husband(Eric Idle): That's roughly 540,000 glasses, Vicar. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): That's excellent, Husband, excellent. 

Husband(Eric Idle): Yes... it means you can still keep your main sherry supply on the roof, but you can have an emergency supply underneath the vestry of 5,000 gallons. 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and Amontillado in the underground tank! 

Husband(Eric Idle): Absolutely. 

<Direction: The vicar signs a form that Husband hands to him.> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Excellent work, Husband, excellent work. 

Husband(Eric Idle): Not at all, vicar, you're one of our best customers... you and the United States. Well goodbye.

<Direction: pouring himself anothter sherry> 

Vicar(Michael Palin): I am so sorry... do go on. 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): Well, it's just that recently I've begun to worry about... 

Vicar(Michael Palin): Well, look... 

Kirkham(Graham Chapman): I sometimes ask myself - does the Bible intend...

Captain(John Cleese): What's that? 

<Direction: They am both struggling to restrain MacDonald.> 

RSM(Terry Jones): It's the fifth state that a Scotsman can achieve, sir. He's got to finish himself off by lunchtime or he thinks he's let down the Emperor, sir. 

Captain(John Cleese): Well, can't we get him out of it? 

RSM(Terry Jones): Oh, I dunno how to, sir. Our Kamikaze instructor, Mr Yashimoto, was so good he never left Tokyo airport. 

Captain(John Cleese): Well, there must be someone else who can advise us?

RSM(Terry Jones): Yes, no time to lose, sir! 

Captain(John Cleese): Right. 

RSM(Terry Jones): Isn't that funny, sir... I've never come across that phrase before - 'no time to lose'. Forty-two years I've been in the regular army and I've never heard that phrase. 

Captain(John Cleese): Well, it's in perfectly common parlance. 

RSM(Terry Jones): In what, sir? 

Captain(John Cleese): Oh never mind... right ... no time to lose. 

RSM(Terry Jones): Eventually, yes, sir. 

Captain(John Cleese): What? 

RSM(Terry Jones): Like you say, sir. We'll be able to make time, eventually without to lose, sir, no. 

Captain(John Cleese): Look, I don't think you've quite got the hang of this phrase, sergeant major. 

<Direction: The same frontage of smart London salon as before. Only this time the big sign reads 'No Time To Lose Advice Centre'. The same bowler-hatted man goes in. The same interior, same desk. A consultant sits behind it, and motions for the man to sit down.>

<Direction: He gets out a two-foot-square cube with 'no time to lose' in the same lettering as it always is, and puts it on the desk. He points to this in a manic way with a forefinger. He has the words 'no time to lose' on the back of his hand. sings to stop the manic fit he reaches inside desk, pours a drink from a bottle on which is written 'no time to lose'> 

Consultant(Eric Idle): Now, you want to use this phrase in everyday conversation, is that right? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes, that's right. 

Consultant(Eric Idle): Yes ... good ... 

<Direction: He stands up, makes a strange noise, and flings the back of his jacket up over his head revealing 'no time to lose' written on the inside of the back lining of his jacket, upside down so that it is the right way up when it is revealed.> 

Man(Michael Palin): You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to say to each other ... 

<Direction: tragic, heart-rending music creeps in under the dialogue> 

Man(Michael Palin): In the old days we used to find things to say, like 'pass the sugar'... or, 'that's my flannel', but in the last ten or fifteen years there just hasn't seemed to be anything to say, and anyway I saw your phrase advertised in the paper and I thought, that's the kind of thing I'd like to say to her... 

<Direction: The consultant pushes down a handle and a large screen comes up in front of him. On it is written 'no time to lose'. He burts through the paper.> 

Consultant(Eric Idle): Yes, well, what we normally suggest for a beginner such as yourself, is that you put your alarm clock back ten minutes in the morning, so you can wake up, look at the clock and use the phrase immediately. 

<Direction: he holds up the card briefly> 

Consultant(Eric Idle): Shall we try it? 

Man(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Consultant(Eric Idle): All right - I'll be the alarm clock. When I go off, look at me and use the phrase, OK? 

<Direction: ticks then imitates ringing>

Voice Over(Michael Palin): So it was that on a cold November morning, RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald, one of the most highly trained Kamikaze experts the Scottish Highlands have ever witnessed, left on a mission which was to... oh I can't go on with this drivel. 

<Direction: By this time we have cut to a close up of the cab to show RSM Urdoch at the wheel, with MacDonald beside him. MacDonald has a revolver and is apparently having an unsuccessful game of Russian roulette.> 

RSM(Terry Jones): All right, MacDonald, no time to lose.

MacDonald(Graham Chapman): Aaaaaaugh! 

<Direction: The RSM slams the brakes on. Skidding noises. Cut to shot of the lorry skidding to a halt. The RSM leaps out, picks up MacDonald who is lying on the floor hitting himself, and loads him into the back of the lorry. He gets back into the lorry and they start off again. They haven't gone more than a few yards before we see MacDonald leap out of the back of the lorry, race round to the front and throw himself down in front of the lorry. The lorry runs right over him. He picks himself up after it has gone, races up to the front and tries it again... and again... and again... and again... and again... Cut to the captain, standing in front of a huge map. He points with a stick.> 

Captain(John Cleese): Well, that's the mission - now here's the method. RSM Murdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by giving them large quantities of money, a good home, and a steady job. Then, when they're upstairs with the wife, Sapper MacDonald will hurl himself at the secret documents, destroying them and himself. Well, that's the plan, the time is now 19.42 hours. I want you to get to bed, have a good night's rest and be up on parade early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a lovely supper.

None(None): 'THE GATHERING STORM' 

<Direction: Cut to presenter at desk.> 

Presenter(John Cleese): Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind. Professor Rosewall of the Laver Institute. 

<Direction: A scientist with tennis courts in the background. He wears a white coat. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'PROF. KEN ROSEWALL' Australian accent> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): Hello. Here at the Institute Professor Charles Pasarell, Dr Peaches Bartkowicz and myself have been working on the theory originally postulated by the late Dr Kramer that the penguin is intrinsically more intelligent than the human being. 

<Direction: He moves over to a large diagram which is being held by two tennis players in full tennis kit but wearing the brown coats of ordinary laboratory technicians. The diagram shows a penguin and a man in correct proportional size with their comparative brain capacities marked out clearly showing the man's to be much larger than the penguin's.> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): The first thing that Dr Kramer came up with was that the penguin has a much smaller brain than the man. This postulate formed the fundamental basis of all his thinking and remained with him until his death. 

<Direction: Flash cut of elderly man in tennis shirt and green eye shade getting an arrow in the head. Cut back to the scientist now with diagram behind him. It shows a man and a six foot penguin.> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): Now we've taken this theory one stage further. If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height as the man and then compare the relative brain sizes, we now find that the penguin's brain is still smaller. But, and this is the point, it is larger than it was. 

<Direction: Very quick cut of tennis crowd going 'oh' and applauding. Dr Peaches Bartkowicz standing by tennis net. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'DR PEACHES BARTKOWICZ'> 

Peaches(Michael Palin): For a penguin to have the same size of brain as a man the penguin would have to be over sixty-six feet high. 

<Direction: She moves to the left and comes upon a cut-out of the lower visible part of a sixty-six feet high penguin. She looks up at it. Cut back to the scientist.> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): This theory has become known as the waste of time theory and was abandoned in 1956. 

<Direction: slight edit with jump visible he refers to graph decorated with little racquets which shows bushmen with 23, penguins with 13 and BBC planners' with 8>

Hoad(Eric Idle): These IQ tests were thought to contain an unfair cultural bias against the penguin. For example, it didn't take into account the penguins extremely poor educational system. To devise a fairer system of test, a team of our researchers spent eighteen months in Antarctica living like penguins, and subsequently dying like penguins - only quicker - proving that the penguin is a clever little sod in his own environment. 

<Direction: Cut to the scientist.> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): Therefore we devised tests to be given to the penguins in the fourth set ... I do beg your pardon, in their own environment.

<Direction: Cut back to the scientist.> 

Scientist(Graham Chapman): The environmental barrier had been removed but we'd hit another: the language barrier. The penguins could not speak English and were therefore unable to give the answers. This problem was removed in the next series of experiments by asking the same questions to the penguins and to a random group of non-English-speaking humans in the same conditions. 

<Direction: Cut to the professor and his team now surrounding a group of foreigners who are standing in a pool looking bewildered.> 

Professor(Terry Jones): What is the next number? 2, 4, 6...

First Zambesi(Graham Chapman): Are you sure that's working all right? 

Second Zambesi(Terry Jones): Yes, thank you dear. It's marvellous. I think if we can win one or two of the early primaries, we could split the urban Republican vote wide open.

Handing off a strong tackle and dodging with her, he side steps amd slips Mrs Colyer to a back who makes a run through and touches her down between the posts.

Voice Over(Graham Chapman): So, on June 7th, 1783, the Montgolfier brothers had a really good wash ... starting on his face and arms, Joseph Michael Montgolfier went on to scrub his torso, his legs and his naughty bits, before rinsing his whole body. That June night, he and his brother between them washed seventeen square feet of body area. They used a kilo and a half of catholic soap and nearly fourteen gallons of nice hot water. It was indeed an impressive sight.

It's in an attractive hand-tooled binding, is priced Â£5 and failure to buy it will make you liable to a Â£50 fine or three months' imprisonment. There's also a record of someone reading the book of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', a crochet-work bedspread with the words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' on it, available from the BBC, price Â£18 or five months' imprisonment and there are matching toilet-seat covers and courtesy mats with illustrations of many of the baboons mentioned.

Occasionally he goes over to her, takes a measurement and goes back to his desk to write it down.> 

Antoinette(Carol Cleveland): Oh Joseph, all you think about is balloons... all you talk about is balloons. Your beautiful house is full of bits and pieces of balloons... your books are all about balloons... every time you sing a song, it is in some way obliquely connected with balloons... everything you eat has to have 'balloon' incorporated in the title... your dogs are an called 'balloonno'... you tie balloons to your ankles in the evenings. 

Joseph(Terry Jones): I don't do that! 

Antoinette(Carol Cleveland): Well, no, you don't do that, but you do duck down and shout 'Hey! Balloons!' when there are none about. Your whole life is becoming obsessively balloonic, you know. Why do I have to hang from this bloody gas bag all day? Don't I mean anything to you?

Jacques(Eric Idle): Well, it is indeed a great honour Your Majesty, that I cannot refuse. 

Louis(Michael Palin): Right! OK! Let's get 'em.

Joseph(Terry Jones): Just a moment! 

Jacques(Eric Idle): Joseph! 

<Direction: indicating the king> 

Joseph(Terry Jones): This man is not Louis XIV! 

Jacques(Eric Idle): Joseph! Are you out of your mind! 

Joseph(Terry Jones): I've been looking it up in my bath. Louis XIV died in 1717. It's now 1783! Answer me that!

Butler(Graham Chapman): I got as far as the sideboard, sir... 

<Direction: Louis and his dukes grab the plans and push past the butler and across to an open window. There is a bit of a scuffle at the window as they are clambering out at the same time as two men in black with a projector and screen are clambering in.> 

Joseph(Terry Jones): Stop them... oh! Ah... oooooohh! 

<Direction: to Jacques> 

Butler(Graham Chapman): No news on the canal I'm afraid, sir, but apparently in India they're thinking of building a railway between the towns of Lahore... 

Joseph(Terry Jones): Stop... ow! Stop them, O'Toole for... oh! shit! God's sake... stop them, they've got the plans!

None(None): Establishing shot of large Harrods-type store. Outside limousines and taxis are disgorging very rich customers. Small doormen in enormously large coats opening door of cars. A man with his nose bandaged comes out of the store. One large car pulls softly up to the curb, and as small doorman (Michael) opens its door, an enormously opulent lady (Terry J) in furs gets out. The doorman holds the door open. She knees him in the groin and walks on into the store. Chris Quinn (Eric) arrives on a bicycle. He parks the bicycle against the curb (the doorman flings it into the road) and goes into the outer hall of the store. He passes a couple leaving who also have noses bandaged. A gaggle of customers, mostly pepperpots, rush out. A very eager pepperpot lady shopper, going the other way, rushes between the two and bangs into a set of glass doors which have closed behind the gaggle. She cries out with pain clutching her nose and is escorted away by a large, coated attendant. Chris Quinn looks up at the list on the wall. It reads:

<Direction: Quinn, knowing that there are doors, goes forward more cautiously and enters. The banging of noses on glass doors is a constant background theme. Cut to the gift department. A large lady is standing by counter holding a large cylinder with a rose attachment.> 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): Yes this looks the sort of thing. May I just try it? 

Assistant(Terry Gilliam): Certainly, madam. 

<Direction: The lady presses button and a sheet of flame shoots out across the hall.> 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): Oh! Sorry! 

Lady(None): So 

<Direction: she is happy though> 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): Yes that's fine. 

Assistant(Terry Gilliam): Is that on account, madam? 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): Yes. 

<Direction: Chris walks by, watching with interest but not much concern, passing a customer whose back is on fire but who has not noticed. He approaches a counter with a sign saying 'Ant Counter'. He stands by the apparently empty counter for one moment, then rings a bell.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Hello? Hello? 

<Direction: A strange rubber-masked head appears from below the other side of the counter and gesticulates at him making a strange noise. This soon stops.> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, I'm terribly sorry... 

<Direction: he takes off the mask to reveal a straight forward assistant> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I thought you were someone else. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh I see, yes. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I'm sorry sir, can I help you? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes, yes, as a matter of fact you can, actually I was interested in the possibility... of purchasing one of your ... can I ask who you thought I was? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): What? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Who did you think I was... just then... when you thought I was somebody. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well I might know them. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): It's possible, obviously, but I think it's really unlikely. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, I know quite a lot... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I mean he's hardly likely to move in your circles, sir... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Why, is he very 

Chris(None): rich 

Chris(Eric Idle): ? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Is he a lord or something? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, not at all. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well look, this is very easy to settle. What is his name?. 

Chris(Eric Idle): What is his name? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Well... er... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Michael Ellis. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Who? 

Chris(Eric Idle): I see. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Do you know him, sir? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Er ... Michael Ellis. Michael Ellis... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): You don't 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, I don't remember the name. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I think you would remember him, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Why do you say that? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Well, would you remember a man six foot nine inches high, fortyish, and he's got a long scar from here to here and absolutely no nose? 

Chris(Eric Idle): ... oh, I think I do remember somebody like that... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Well, that's not Michael Ellis. 

Chris(Eric Idle): What? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): He's a small man about this high with a high-pitched voice. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Right, I'm not going to buy an ant from you now. 

<Direction: distressed> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, please. 

Chris(Eric Idle): No. You've not been properly trained. I demand another assistant. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, come on... please... 

Chris(Eric Idle): No, I want 

Chris(None): another assistant 

Chris(Eric Idle): . 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): All right! I'll get another assistant. 

<Direction: he disappears behind a curtain> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Thank you. 

<Direction: The same assistant reappears with a long mandarin-style Chinese moustache. high-pitched voice> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Hello sir, can I help you, sir? 

Chris(Eric Idle): No, I want a 

Chris(None): different 

Chris(Eric Idle): assistant. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I 

First Assistant(None): am 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): sir, I'm Mr Abanazar, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Don't be silly. 

<Direction: normal voice> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh no, please please please let me help you... 

Chris(Eric Idle): No! I want another assistant. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, come on, please... 

Chris(Eric Idle): If you don't give me another assistant... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really. 

<Direction: he becomes exaggeratedly polite> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Good morning, sir... how are you, sir... bit parky outside today... isn't it, sir... ? A very nice suit you've got there, sir... you had a very close shave this morning, sir... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Right I'm going! 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): No, no, please... 

<Direction: he takes off his moustache he rings the bell on the counter. After a pause, very slowly indeed an identical mask to the first appears over the top of the counter right next to the first assistant, making the same noise very quietly. The first assistant sees him, starts and nudges him hard.> 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): Woooooo ....ooooooo... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): It's not him! 

<Direction: The second assistant makes a disappointed noise and disappears below. pointing over the counter at the disappeared assistant him> 

Chris(Eric Idle): ! 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh please, give him a chance! 

Chris(Eric Idle): No! 

<Direction: appearing from below counter without a mask, looking immaculate> 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): Yes, sir, can I be of any assistance? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh no, come on, don't try that! 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): I'm sorry, sir... try what? 

Chris(Eric Idle): You know perfectly well what I mean. 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): I'm afraid I don't, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): You were down behind there with a silly mask on going wooo-ooo... 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): I don't think I was, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): All right, get the manager. 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Manager! 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): This is the manager, sir. 

<Direction: in a silly voice> 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): Yes, I'm the manager. 

<Direction: he keeps calling> 

Second Assistant(Michael Palin): It's a smashing store this, I can't recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage. Oh yes, the freshest haddock in London, second floor, third floor Ribena, ants here, television and flame throwers over there, behind them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six... 

<Direction: nudging him> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Quick! 

<Direction: They both disappear under the counter. The real manager arrives and presents himself to Chris.> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Yes, sir? Can I help you, sir? 

<Direction: noticing the 'manager' badge on his lapel> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes, I want to complain about the assistants on this counter. 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): I'm sorry to hear that, sir, which ones? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, they're hiding now. 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Sir? 

Chris(Eric Idle): They're hiding, down there behind the counter. 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): I see, sir. 

<Direction: he goes round counter, looks, but obviously can't see them; Chris goes round to join in the search> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): ... well... there's nobody down here, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): They must have crawled through here, and made their escape through 'Soft Toys'. 

<Direction: he points> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Yes, of course. 

Chris(Eric Idle): They were wearing masks and making silly noises and one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this.. 

<Direction: he does an impression> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Ah! I think I've got it, sir, I think I've got it! It's rag week. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Ragweek? 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Yes, you know, for charity, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh! I see. Some local college or university? 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): No, no it's the 

Real Manager(None): store's 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): rag week. 

Chris(Eric Idle): The 

Chris(None): store's 

Chris(Eric Idle): rag week? 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Yes. The senior staff don't join in much - it's for the trainees really... 

Chris(Eric Idle): It's not very good for business is it? 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Oh, It's for charity, sir. People are awfully good about it, you know. 

<Direction: he rattles a collecting tin> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes, yes, of course. 

<Direction: he puts a coin in> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Right, sir, I'll get you a senior assistant - ants, was it? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes, please. 

<Direction: calling Mr Snetterton approaches immediately; he is clearly the first assistant with very bad short crew-cut wig on> 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): Could you look after this gentleman, Mr Snetterton? 

Chris(Eric Idle): I don't want him! 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh 

First Assistant(None): please! 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Give me a chance! 

Real Manager(Terry Jones): All right - Mr Hartford! 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Yes - good morning, sir - can I help you? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes, please, I'm interested in buying an ant. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of paying, sir? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh, well, I hadn't actually got as far as that. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Well sir, they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, I should think one about one and a half p., please. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh ... medium? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir. 

<Direction: he tips some ants - which we can't see - out into a special ring on counter> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): That one there is an Ayrshire, and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan. 

Chris(Eric Idle): That's a nice one. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Let's see how you get on with him, eh? 

<Direction: he puts it on Chris's hand> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Ah yes, he likes you. He's taken to you. 

Chris(Eric Idle): What do you feed them on? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Blancmange. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Blancmange? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, you don't feed them at all. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, what do they live on? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): They don't. They die. 

Chris(Eric Idle): They die? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Well of course they do, if you don't feed them. 

Chris(Eric Idle): I don't understand. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): You let them die, then you buy another one. It's much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant variety of little companions. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh, I see. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): That's the advantage of owning an ant. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Right, well I'll take this one. Oh dear, I've dropped it... 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Never mind. Here's another one. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Is there anything else I'll need? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Yes, sir - you'll need an ant house. 

<Direction: he produces a birdcage> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): This is the model we recommend, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Won't it get out of there? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Yes. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well what's the point of having the cage? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Well, none at all really. And then some pieces of cage furniture which will keep him entertained. 

<Direction: he produces microscopic things> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Here's an ant-wheel, ant-swing, and a very nice one here, a little ladder - he can run up there and ring the bell at the top, that's a little trick he can learn. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Will he live long enough? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Not really, no, but it's best to have one just in case, and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of course you'll need the book. 

<Direction: he produces an expensive-looking book, thoughtlessly slams it down where the ants were, then hurriedly brushes them away> 

Chris(Eric Idle): The book? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Yes, the book on ants. 

<Direction: looking unsure> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes... 

Hartford(Michael Palin): So, sir, that is, if I may say so, one hundred and eighty-four pounds one and a half p., sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Will you take a cheque? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving a blood-sample, and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just here, sir ... 

<Direction: indicates a point behind his ear he hands him a little knife and some cotton wool> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh, well I think I'll put it on account. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): I should, sir... much less painful. Anyway sir, you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a friend for its life anyway... 

<Direction: Hartford loads the large cage, furniture, two-way radio and the book on ants into a huge box; with some difficulty he finds the ant; he picks it up carefully he drops him in the big box and pushes it across the counter; the box has on one side, in large letters 'live ant: handle with care'; it has breathing holes in it> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): If the little chap should go to an early grave, sir, give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope, all right? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Thanks very much indeed. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Not at all, thank 

Hartford(None): you 

Hartford(Michael Palin): , Mr Ellis. 

<Direction: Chris turns sharply. The first assistant comes quickly up to Hartford.> 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Sssssshh! 

Chris(Eric Idle): What did you say? 

Hartford(Michael Palin): I said thank you, Mr Ellis... 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): It's not him. 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Oh! 

Chris(Eric Idle): Why did you say I was Mr Ellis? 

<Direction: innocently> 

Hartford(Michael Palin): Who? 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): No, he didn't say that. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Yes he did. I heard him say 'Thank you, Mr Ellis'. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): Oh, no, no - he said 'I'm jealous'. 

First Assistant(Graham Chapman): I'm jealous of your ant. Goodbye. Goodbye. 

<Direction: waves pointedly leaving the counter> 

Chris(Eric Idle): I don't care who Michael Ellis is! 

<Direction: Chris passes a shop area labelled 'The Paisley Counter' where two customers are talking to mirrors in thick Irish accents. Chris moves on to lift. A little old lady passes, oblivious to the fact that her shopping trolley is smouldering. The lady passes and Chris is about to enter. Will Mr Michael Ellis please go straight to the manager's office... I'll repeat that... Chris wheels round and listens Will Mr Nigel Mellish please go straight to the manager's office. Chris narrows his eyes suspiciously and gets into the lift cautiously. Cut to the kitchen in Chris Quinn's home. His mother is putting chopped meat into a line af at least half a dozen feeding bowls with various animal names on them. 'Babboon', 'Dromedary', 'Gorilla', 'Trout', and 'Pangolin'. There is a tiger in a cage in the middle of the kitchen, with a bowl marked 'Tiger' in front of him. A large cobra is hanging from the clothes drier and a wolf is in a cage below the sink. A monkey is on top of one of the cupboards. Chris enters with the box.> 

Mother(Terry Jones): What have you got now? 

Chris(Eric Idle): I bought an ant, mother. 

Mother(Terry Jones): What d'you want one of them for! I'm not going to clean it out. You said you'd clean the tiger out, but do you? No, I suppose you've lost interest in it now. Now it'll be ant ant ant for a couple of days, then all of a sudden, 'oh, mum, I've bought a sloth' or some other odd-toed ungulate like a tapir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): It's really different this time, mum. I'm really going to look after this ant. 

Mother(Terry Jones): That's what you said about the sperm whale... now your papa's having to use it as a garage. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, you didn't feed it properly. 

Mother(Terry Jones): Where are we going to get forty-four tons of plankton from every morning? Your papa was dead vexed about that. They thought he was mad in the deli. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well at least he's got a free garage. 

<Direction: growl from the tiger> 

Mother(Terry Jones): That's no good to him... his Hillman smells all fishy. 

<Direction: we hear a roar> 

Mother(Terry Jones): Oh blimey, that's the tiger. He'll want his mandies. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Are you giving that tiger drugs? 

Mother(Terry Jones): ' 

Mother(None): Course 

Mother(Terry Jones): I'm giving it drugs! 

Chris(Eric Idle): It's illegal. 

Mother(Terry Jones): You try telling that to the tiger. 

Chris(Eric Idle): I think it's dangerous. 

Mother(Terry Jones): Listen ... before he started fixing, he used to get through four Jehovah's witnesses a day. And he used to eat all of them, except the pamphlets. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well he's not dim. 

<Direction: A very loud roar and rattling of cage.> 

Mother(Terry Jones): All right! 

<Direction: She loads a syringe and starts to leave.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, I'm going to watch one of the televisions... come on Marcus. 

<Direction: He puts Marcus in cage and is just about to take it through to the next room.> 

Mother(Terry Jones): Michael's been on the phone all day for you. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Michael? 

Mother(Terry Jones): You know, Michael... 

Mother(None): Michael 

Mother(None): Ellis 

Mother(Terry Jones): . He's been on the phone all day ... he came round twice. 

Chris(Eric Idle): What did he look like? 

Mother(Terry Jones): Oh, I didn't see him. The orange-rumped agouti answered the door. Only useful animal you ever bought, that. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Where is he now? 

Mother(Terry Jones): He's upstairs forging prescriptions for the sodding tiger! 

Chris(Eric Idle): No, no, where is Michael Ellis now? 

Mother(Terry Jones): Oh, I don't know... he said it wasn't important, anyway... all right, here I come. 

<Direction: She goes to the tiger. Chris looks confused, then shrugs and goes into the sitting room with Marcus. In the room there are about twenty old televisions on shelves. Chris selects one of the televisions, puts it on the table, switches it on and settles down to watch it with Marcus. CAPTION on the TV : 'UNIVERSITY OF THE AIR' on the TV>

<Direction: mother switches it off> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Hey! I was watching that... 

Mother(Terry Jones): Bloody thing. It's upsetting the tiger.

Chris(Eric Idle): legs, Marcus! 

Ant Expert(Terry Jones): Well I can assure you they do, Mr Ellis. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Hey! You've got two legs missing! And that's a false feeler Marcus! Blimey! 

<Direction: He leaps up, switches the TV off and hurls it into the corner onto a pile of used TVs, and hurries out. The tiger is quiet now. Mother, bloody and torn, is emptying a tin of 'Kit-E-Cobra' into a box marked 'Cobra'.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): I'm taking this ant back, mother - he's got two legs missing. 

Mother(Terry Jones): Hey! Mrs McWong's been on the phone! The polar bear's been in her garden again. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well I'll get it on the way back from the store. 

Mother(Terry Jones): Well mind you do - his droppings are enormous. 

<Direction: Chris goes through the door, mother shouts after him she tosses a wad out to him Cut to the garden outside. There are TVs heaped in the garden path. Chris catches the wad of notes and leaves through the garden gate as a TV van is unloading half a dozen TVs onto a trolley, prior to wheeling them into the house.>

Chris(Eric Idle): Thank you. 

<Direction: the doors shut but we can just hear her voice> 

Lift Woman(Michael Palin): Fourth floor... kiddies' vasectomies...

Gladys(Graham Chapman): I think they're in surgical appliances now. 

Assistant(Michael Palin): That's right, yes, you go left at artificial limbs and hearing aids, right at dentures and it's on your left just by glass eyes. It doesn't say toupees to avoid embarrassing people, but you can smell 'em.

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Tennis ball. 

Tennyson(None): Son, son. 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Sorry - Alfred Lord, who is evidently Lord Tennisball's son. And to start off I'm going to ask Mr Wadsworth to recite his latest offering, a little pram entitled 'I wandered lonely as a crab' and it's all about ants. 

<Direction: Murmur of exalted anticipation. Wordsworth rises rather gloomily.> 

Wordsworth(Terry Jones): I wandered lonely as a 

Wordsworth(None): cloud 

Wordsworth(None): That floats on high over vales and hills 

Wordsworth(None): When all at once I saw a crowd 

Wordsworth(None): A host of golden worker ants. 

<Direction: Ripples of applause.> 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Thank you, thank you, Mr Bradlaugh. Now, Mr Bysshe. 

Shelley(Terry Gilliam): Shelley. 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Oh... 

<Direction: the dwarf refills her glass> 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): ... is going to read one of his latest psalms, entitled 'Ode to a crab'. 

<Direction: rising: and taking his place quietly I met a traveller in an antique land Who said 'Six vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert And on the pedestal these words appear My name is Ozymandias, King of Ants oohs from his audience Look on my feelers, termites, and despair I am the biggest ant you'll ever see The ants of old weren't half as bold and big And fierce as me'. Enormous applause.> 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Thank you Mr Amontillado. I'd like to ask one or two of you at the back not to soil the carpet, there is a restroom upstairs if you find the poems too exciting 

<Direction: she falls over she falls off the podium> 

Keats(Eric Idle): My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains 

Keats(None): My senses, as though an anteater I'd seen 

<Direction: panic spreads and the audience half rise A nasty long-nosed brute screams from the audience With furry legs and sticky darting tongue I seem to feel its cruel jaws Crunch crunch there go my legs Snap snap my thorax too various screaming women faint My head's in a twain, there goes my brain Swallow, swallow, swallow, slurp he loses control> 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Mr Keats, Mr Keats, please leave immediately. 

Keats(Eric Idle): It's true. Don't you see. It's true. It happens. 

<Direction: she bustles him out> 

Old Lady(Graham Chapman): Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize for that last... well I hesitate to call it a pram ... but I had no idea ... and talking of filth... I have asked you once about the carpet ... Now, I do appreciate that last poem was very frightening... but please! Now before we move on to tea and pramwiches, I would like to ask Arthur Lord Tenniscourt to give us his latest little plum entitled 'The Charge of the Ant Brigade'. 

Tennyson(None): Half an inch, half an inch... 

<Direction: Enter Queen Victoria with a fanfare, followed by Albert's coffin. The Queen, the Queen. they all bow and scrape> 

Queen Victoria(Michael Palin): My loyal subjects, we are here today on a matter of national import. My late husband and we are increasingly disturbed by recent developments in literary style 

<Direction: developing a German accent> 

Queen Victoria(Michael Palin): that have taken place here in Germany ... er England. There seems to be an increasing tendency for ze ent... the ent... the ant... to become the dominant ... was is der deutsches Entwicklungsbund... 

Attendant(None): Theme. 

Queen Victoria(Michael Palin): Theme ... of modern poetry here in Germany. We are not ... amusiert? 

<Direction: an attendant whispers> 

Queen Victoria(Michael Palin): Entertained. From now on, ants is verboten. Instead it's skylarks, daffodils, nightingales, light brigades and ... was ist das schreckliche Gepong ... es schmecke wie ein Scheisshaus... und so weiter. Well, we must away now or we shall be late for the races. God bless you alles. 

<Direction: Chris leaves. We cut to him outside a door with a sign saying 'Electric Kettles'.> 

Voice(Terry Jones): Psst! Electric kettles over here, Sir. 

<Direction: A hand holding a sign saying 'Toupees' beckons him. He goes over to door and is ushered through. There are pictures of famous bald world figures with toupees on the walls.> 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Don't worry, sir, you're among friends now, sir. 

<Direction: the manager has an appalling toupee; Chris sees it and tries not to stare; the manager introduces his assistants Bradford and Crawley come forward; each has a toupee worse than the others> 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): These are our fitters, sir. We've had a lot of experience in this field and we do pride ourselves we offer the best and most discreet service available. I don't know whether you'll believe this sir, but one of us is actually wearing a toupee at this moment... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, you all are, aren't you? 

<Direction: They rush to a mirror.> 

Bradford(Michael Palin): Have you got one? 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Yes, but I didn't know... 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): I didn't realize that you two... I thought it was me, 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Yes, I thought it was me. 

Bradford(Michael Palin): So did I. 

<Direction: to Crawley> 

Bradford(Michael Palin): That is good. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Actually, I only came in here to ask where the manager's office was. 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Just a minute - someone told you we all had toupees? 

Chris(Eric Idle): No. 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Oh yeah? 

Bradford(Michael Palin): How did you know? 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well ... it's pretty obvious, isn't it? 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): What do you mean obvious! His is undetectable. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Well, it's a different colour, for a start. 

Bradford(Michael Palin): Is it? 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Course it isn't! 

Chris(Eric Idle): And it doesn't fit in with the rest of his hair... it sort of sticks up in the middle. 

Bradford(Michael Palin): It's better than yours. 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

Chris(Eric Idle): I'm not wearing one. 

<Direction: they all jeer> 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Oh, I see, you haven't got one. 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Why did you come in here then? 

Chris(Eric Idle): They told me to find the manager's office here. 

<Direction: They all jeer again.> 

Bradford(Michael Palin): Oh no, not again. 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): That's a bit lame, isn't it... 

Chris(Eric Idle): It's the truth! 

All(None): Manager's office. 

<Direction: they laugh mockingly> 

Bradford(Michael Palin): Yeah, look at it. Where did you get that, Mac Fisheries? 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Dreadful, isn't it? 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Nylon? 

Chris(Eric Idle): It's not, it's real look. 

<Direction: he pulls it> 

All(None): Oh yeah, anyone can do that. 

<Direction: They all do the same. Bradford incautiously pulls his loose.> 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Come on, get if off. 

Chris(Eric Idle): Get away. 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Look, do you want a proper one? 

Chris(Eric Idle): No, I don't need one. 

Bradford(Michael Palin): There's no need to be ashamed. 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): We've all owned up. 

<Direction: They all look at each other for a moment, registering 'a hard case'.> 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): Don't you see... this is something you've got to come to terms with. 

Chris(Eric Idle): I am not wearing a toupee! They just told me to come in here to find the manager's office, to complain about my ant! 

<Direction: They look at each other.> 

Crawley(Graham Chapman): Pathetic, isn't it. 

Bradford(Michael Palin): Complain about an ant? 

Toupee Manager(Terry Jones): This is for your own good. 

<Direction: He grabs Chris's hair. A fight ensues in which all the assistants get their toupees dislodged. Chris is backed up against a door marked: 'Strictly no admittance'. He suddenly ducks out through this door. Cut to the other side of the door. Chris turns and double takes. It is the manager's office. There is a long line of people sitting waiting to complain. The manager looks up. irritably> 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): All right. Take a seat. 

<Direction: Chris shuts the door and takes a seat at the end of a line often people waiting to complain: the German clothes prop man; the Icelandic honey week man; a Greek with a motor tyre; a man with a lawn mower with a cat sticking out of it; a man with a bandaged nose holding a dog with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose and a pram with a small column of smoke rising from it; a rather butch lady with her head through a tennis racket; a man with a cigar in his mouth that has obviously exploded - his face is blackened and his collar awry; a man in a terrible suit with one arm twice as long as a normal sleeve and trousers that finish at mid-thigh. A uniformed shop attendant is sitting next to a rather well dressed lady in twin set and pearls, and her equally distinguished looking husband. The attendant is occasionally touching the lady's cheek and peering into her eyes. The lady and the husband stare straight ahead. Next to them is Colonel Ewing. At the desk is the lady with the flame thrower. Part of the manager's desk and the entire corner of the office are blackened and smoking.> 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): You see! There ought to be a safety catch on it, I mean ... ohhhh! 

<Direction: a spurt of flame shoots out> 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): I mean, what if this fell into the wrong hands? 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Yes, madam. I'll speak to the makers personally, all right? 

Lady(Carol Cleveland): Would you? It would put my mind at ease. 

<Direction: She leaves closing the door. We hear the flame thrower.> 

Lady's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Sorry... 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Next? 

<Direction: The colonel gets up. As he does so Mr Zyndenky (the husband) indicates his wife and the attendant.> 

Mr Zyndersky(Terry Gilliam): He's still molesting her. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Yes, yes, I'll see to you in a moment, sir. 

<Direction: the colonel sits at the manager's desk> 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): I've got a complaint to make. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on fire. 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Oh, not at all. 

<Direction: he sits on it> 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): I got used to this out east. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Where were you out east? 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Oh, Norway ... Sweden ... places like that... oh I'm terribly sorry, my suit seems to keep catching fire. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Extinguisher? 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Oh no, thank you, I think we'd better let it run its course. I was just thinking... Norway is not very east, is it? I should have said when I was out north. 

<Direction: he slaps at the flames> 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Are there many fires in Norway? 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Good Lord yes. The place is a constant blaze. Wooden buildings, d'you know. I lost my wife in Norway. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): I am sorry to hear that. 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Why, did you know her? 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): No, I meant... 

Colonel Ewing(Graham Chapman): Oh I see. No, she wasn't a favourite of mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a load of old scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado. 

Complaints Manager(Michael Palin): Yes, yes - well look... 

<Direction: Ding-dong of store PA. An announcer speaks. Here is an important announcement about Michael Ellis. Chris looks up at loudspeaker; everyone turns towards it murmur of excitment> 

Chris(Eric Idle): What a rotten ending. 

<Direction: Cut to a polite, well dressed assistant at a counter with a big sign saying 'End of Show Department' behind him.> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Well it is one of our cheapest, sir. 

Chris(Eric Idle): What else have you got? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Well, there's the long slow pull-out, sir, you know, the camera tracks back and back and mixes... 

<Direction: As he speaks we pull out and mix through to the exterior of the store. Mix through to even wider zoom ending up in aerial view of London. It stops abruptly and we cut back to Chris.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): No, have you got anything more exciting? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): How about a chase? 

<Direction: The manager and the toupee assistants suddenly, appear at a door. There he is! Exciting chase music. They pursue Chris out of the hall and into another part of the store. Then cut back to Chris at counter.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh, no, no, no. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Walking into the sunset? 

Chris(Eric Idle): What's that one? 

<Direction: Dramatic sunset shot on a beach. We can just see the back of Chris and the assistant as they walk together towards the setting sun. The assistant is gesturing and describing it.> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): You know ... two lone figures silhouetted against the dying rays of the setting sun. The music swells, you've got a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye... 

<Direction: Cut back to the store.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Oh no. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Oh, pity, I rather like that one... 

Chris(Eric Idle): They're all a bit off the point, you see. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Well there is one that ties up the whole Michael Ellis thing, but.... 

Chris(Eric Idle): But what... ? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Oh, no, nothing, nothing... 

Chris(Eric Idle): Look, who is this Michael Ellis? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): How about a happy ending, sir? 

<Direction: A girl rushes up to Chris and flings her arms around him.> 

Girl(Carol Cleveland): Oh Chris! Thank God you're safe. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): No, you wouldn't want that, would you. 

<Direction: This time we see the girl has disappeared.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Why wouldn't I want that? 

Assistant(Terry Jones): What about summing up from the panel? That's cheap. You know - the big match experts. 

<Direction: Panel in typical football panel set. Malcolm Allison, Brian Clough, and huge still of Jimmy Hill on set behind.> 

Malcolm Allison(Michael Palin): Yes. It was quite a good show. I think that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone. 

Brian Clough(Eric Idle): Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm, quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now. 

Assistant(Terry Jones): No? Slow fade? 

<Direction: The picture begins to fade.> 

Chris(Eric Idle): Nnnn... no. 

<Direction: The picture comes up again.> 

Assistant(Terry Jones): Well, how about a sudden ending? 

<Direction: Blackout. A high street. Musical theme played on a banjo a la 'Steptoe and Son' opening. Cut to a tracking shot of two tramps walking jauntily along. They are very arch, over-the-top jolly fellows. They nod at the occasional passer-by and do mock bows to a city gent.> 

None(None): TITLE CAPTION: 'UP YOUR PAVEMENT' 

None(None): CAPTION: 'BY THE REV. AND MRS A. G. PHIPPS' 

None(None): CAPTION: 'FROM AN IDEA BY LORD CARRINGTON' 

<Direction: They come to a litter bin, root in it, and one of them produces a newspaper. He hands it to the other, looks in again and brings out a pork pie. He looks in again, his eyes light up, and he produces a bottle of champagne. He passes it to his mate. He looks in again and finds two highly polished glasses. Meanwhile over all this and as they set off down the road together we hear:> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Taking life as it comes, sharing the good things and the bad things, finding laughter and fun wherever they go - it is with these two happy-go-lucky rogues that our story begins. 

<Direction: by this time the tramps have walked out of shot; cut to a shot of a sports car up on the pavement with the legs of the two tramps sticking out from underneath; the music turns more urgent and transatlantic appropriate music; a James Bond character climbs out of the car and looks down at the dead tramps shot of him rushing into a film premiere past photographers with flashing bulbs cut to him on yacht still of him with Henry Kissenger; cut to him striding down a street we see him go into a doorway; cut to a low angle close up of Dr Koning donning gloves prior to the operation; the music changes to the Kildare theme cut to a doorbell and pan down pan down to find the doorbell and name the door opens and the rear-admiral comes striding out; naval music; he walks up the road cut to a still of a young inspired and devoted nurse; the music instantly changes to the heroic mix to impressive college grounds zoom in across lawns towards the college building the camera suddenly veers off away from college and homes in on a solitary bush from which appears a seedy fellow in a terrible lightweight suit of several years ago that has got all stained and creased around the crutch> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Len Hanky! Chiropodist, voyeur, hen-teaser. The man of whom the chairman of Fiat once said... 

<Direction: Cut to a high-powered Italian businessman at a desk in a very modern casa-type Italian office.> 

Chairman(Eric Idle): Che cosa Ã¨ lo succiacatori do polli? 

<Direction: SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: What is a hen-teaser? The phone rings. He answers it dynamically and we zoom in on his tense, alert, executive face.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Yes! Tonight we examine the career of Gino Agnelli! The man who started from nothing to build up one of the greatest firms in Europe. 

<Direction: mix through to stock film of a big car-producing plant as each of these things is mentioned we see a momentary flash of a still of each at this point the freeze frame starts moving as the chaplain lifts himself out of the cockpit and jumps down beside his Spitfire smiling cheerfully he crosses off another emblem of a vicar in a German helmet on the side of the plane. Beside this is written '"Here we come Kraut" Luke 17, verse 3' a squadron leader, just off a mission, runs past, and dashes into a Nissen hut CAPTION: 'SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND, 1944' The squadron leader enters an RAF officers' mess and takes off his helmet.> 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Morning, Squadron Leader. 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): What-ho, Squiffy. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): How was it? 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): Top-hole. Bally Jerry, pranged his kite right in the how's your father. Hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Er, I'm afraid I don't quite follow you, Squadron Leader. 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): It's perfectly ordinary banter, Squiffy. Bally Jerry...pranged his kite right in the how's yer father...hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): No, I'm just not understanding banter at all well today. Give us it slower. 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): Banter's not the 

Squadron Leader(None): same 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): if you say it slower, Squiffy. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Hold on then. 

<Direction: shouts Wingco> 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Yes! 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Bend an ear to the Squadron Leader's banter for a sec, would you? 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Can do. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Jolly good. 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Fire away. 

<Direction: draws a deep breath and looks slightly uncertain, then starts even more deliberately than before can Bertie> 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): ... 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): ...No, don't understand that banter at all. 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): Something up with my banter, chaps? 

<Direction: A siren goes. The door bursts open and an out-of-breath young pilot rushes in in his flying gear.> 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Bunch of monkeys on the ceiling, sir! Grab your egg and fours and let's get the bacon delivered! 

<Direction: General incomprehension. They look at each other.> 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Do you understand that? 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): No, didn't get a word of it. 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Sorry old man, we don't understand your banter. 

Pilot(Michael Palin): You know...bally ten-penny ones dropping in the custard... 

<Direction: searching for words> 

Pilot(Michael Palin): un...Charlie Choppers chucking a handful... 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): No, no...sorry. 

Bovril(Terry Jones): Say it a bit slower, old chap. 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Slower 

Pilot(None): banter 

Pilot(Michael Palin): , sir? 

Wingco(Graham Chapman): Ra-ther! 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Um...sausage squad up the blue end? 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): No, still don't get it. 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Um...cabbage crates coming over the briny? 

Squadron Leader(Eric Idle): No. 

Others(None): No, no.... 

<Direction: Stock film of a German bombing raid.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): But by then it was too late. The first cabbage crates hit London on July the 7th. That was just the beginning. 

<Direction: Cut to a Whitehall war office conference room. A general is on the phone. Four other generals sit there.> 

General(Graham Chapman): Five shillings a dozen? That's ordinary cabbages, is it? And what about the bombs?... Good Lord, they 

General(None): are 

General(Graham Chapman): expensive. 

<Direction: A corporal rushes in.> 

Corporal(Eric Idle): Sir! 

General(Graham Chapman): Yes, what is it? 

Corporal(Eric Idle): News from the Western Front, sir. 

General(Graham Chapman): Yes ... ? 

Corporal(Eric Idle): Big enemy attack at dawn, sir ... 

Corporal(Eric Idle): Well, the enemy were all wearing little silver halos, sir ... and ... they had fairy wands with big stars on the end ... and ... 

General(Graham Chapman): They what ... ? 

Corporal(Eric Idle): .. and ... they had spiders in matchboxes, sir. 

<Direction: in disbelief> 

General(Graham Chapman): Good God! How did our chaps react? 

Corporal(Eric Idle): Well, they were jolly interested, sir. Some of them ... I think it was the 4th Armoured Brigade, sir, they ... well, they went and had a look at the spiders, sir. 

General(Graham Chapman): Oh my God! All right, thank you, Shirley. 

<Direction: A girl emerges from under the table. She is a blonde WAAF. to a sergeant the sergeant opens the door, Churchill stands outside the sergeant shuts the door> 

General(Graham Chapman): Gentlemen, it's now quite apparent that the enemy are not only fighting this war on the cheap, but they're also not taking it seriously. 

Ageing General(Terry Gilliam): Bastards ... 

General(Graham Chapman): First they drop cabbages instead of decent bombs ... 

Corporal(Eric Idle): The crates were probably quite expensive, sir. 

General(Graham Chapman): Quiet, critic! And now they're doing very silly things in one of the most vital areas of the war! 

Ageing General(Terry Gilliam): What are we going to do, Shirley? 

General(Graham Chapman): Well, we've got to act fast before it saps morale. We're going to show these Chinese ... 

Captain(None): Germans, sir. 

General(Graham Chapman): These Germans ... we're going to show them that no British soldier will descend to their level. Anyone found trivialising this war will face the supreme penalty that military law can provide. 

<Direction: he holds a heroic pose; there is a pause during which we expect to cut; we don't; suddenly he breaks out of the pose into informality> 

General(Graham Chapman): That was all right, I think? 

<Direction: getting out drinks Seemed to go quite well. Cut to a courtroom in the 1940s. A courtmartial is in progress. An elderly general presides, with two others on either side of him. There is a defense counsel, a prosecutor, a clerk of court, and two men guarding the prisoner.> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Sapper Walters, you stand before this court accused of carrying on the war by other than warlike means - to wit, that you did on April 16th, 1942, dress up as a bag of dainties, flick wet towels at the enemy during an important offensive ... 

Walters(Eric Idle): Well, sir ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Shut up! Colonel Fawcett for the prosecution ... 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir, we all know ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Shut up! 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): I'm sorry? 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Carry on. 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir, we all know the facts of this case; that Sapper Walters, being in possession of expensive military equipment, to wit one Lee Enfield .303 rifle and 72 rounds of ammunition, valued at a hundred and forty pounds three shillings and sixpence, chose instead to use wet towels to take an enemy command post in the area of Basingstoke ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Basingstoke? Basingstoke in Hampshire? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): No, no, no, sir, no. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): I see, carry on. 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): The result of his action was that the enemy ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Basingstoke 

Presiding General(None): where 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): ? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Basingstoke in Westphalia, sir. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Oh I see. Carry on. 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): The result of Sapper Walters's action was that the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases small red strawberry marks upon their thighs ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): I didn't know there 

Presiding General(None): was 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): a Basingstoke in Westphalia. 

<Direction: slightly irritated> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): It's on the map, sir. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): What map? 

<Direction: more irritably> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): The map of Westphalia as used by the army, sir. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Well, I've certainly never heard of Basingstoke in Westphalia. 

<Direction: patiently> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): It's a municipal borough sir, twenty-seven miles north-north east of Southhampton. Its chief manufactures ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): What ... Southhampton in Westphalia? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Yes sir ... bricks ... clothing. Nearby are remains of Basing House, burned down by Cromwell's cavalry in 1645 ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Who compiled this map? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Cole Porter, sir. 

<Direction: incredulously> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Cole Porter ... who wrote `Kiss Me Kate'? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): No, alas not, sir ... this was Cole Porter who wrote `Anything Goes'. Sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before this court ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): That's the same one! 

<Direction: he sings> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): `In olden days a glimpse of stocking ...' 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): I 

Fawcett(None): beg 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): your pardon, sir? 

<Direction: singing> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): `In olden days a glimpse of stocking, was looked on as something shocking, now heaven knows, anything goes ...' 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): No, this one's different, sir. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): How does it go? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): What, sir? 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): How does 

Presiding General(None): your 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): `Anything Goes' go? 

Walters(Eric Idle): Can I go home now? 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Shut up! 

<Direction: to Fawcett> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Come on! 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir, really, this is rather ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Come on, how does your `Anything Goes' go? 

<Direction: clearing his throat and going into an extraordinary tuneless and very loud song Anything goes in. Anything goes out! Fish, bananas, old pyjamas, Mutton! Beef! and Trout! Anything goes in ...> 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): No, that's not it ... carry on. 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): With respect sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before you in the dock being in the possession of the following: one pair of army boots, value three pounds seven and six, one pair of serge trousers, value two pounds three and six, one pair of gaiters value sixty-eight pounds ten shillings, one ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Sixty-eight pounds ten shillings for a pair of 

Presiding General(None): gaiters 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): ? 

<Direction: dismissively> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): They were special gaiters, sir. 

Presiding General(None): Special 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): gaiters? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Yes, sir, they were made in France. One beret costing fourteen shillings, one pair of ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): What was special about them? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Oh ... 

<Direction: as if he can hardly be bothered to reply> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): they were made of a special fabric, sir. The buckles were made of empire silver instead of brass. The total value of the uniform was there ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Why was the accused wearing special gaiters? 

<Direction: irritably> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): They were a presentation pair sir, from the regiment. The total value of the uniform ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Why did they present him with a special pair of gaiters? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir, it seems to me totally irrelevant to the case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not, sir. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): I think the court will be able to judge that for themselves. I want to know why the regiment presented the accused with a special pair of gaiters. 

<Direction: stifling his impatience> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): He ... used to do things for them. The total value ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): What things? 

<Direction: exasperated> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): He .. he used to oblige them, sir. The total value ... 

Presiding General(None): Oblige 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): them? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Yes, sir. The total value of the uniform ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): How did he oblige them? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): What sir? 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): How did he 

Presiding General(None): oblige 

<Direction: more and more irritated> 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): He ... um ... used to make them happy in little ways, sir. The total value of the uniform could therefore not have been less than ... 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Did he touch them at all? 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant. 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): I want to know how he made them happy. 

<Direction: losing his temper>

Walters(Eric Idle): What, me? 

Presiding General(Terry Jones): Yes. What have you got to say? 

Walters(Eric Idle): What can 

Walters(None): I 

Walters(Eric Idle): say? I mean, how can I encapsulate in mere words my scorn for any military solution? The fultility of modern warfare? And the hypocrisy by which contemporary government applies one standard to violence within the community and another to violence perpetrated by one community upon another? 

Defense Counsel(Terry Gilliam): I'm sorry, but my client has become pretentious. I will say in his defense that he has suffered ... 

Fawcett(Michael Palin): Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution!

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTIONS: 'DRAMA!' ' ACTION!' 

<Direction: Build up for abut ten seconds. Cut to a cliff top looking out to sea. A grappling hook comes over and sticks in, then another, and another. Whispered voices, music, the tension rises as the rope is tightened. Then over the top comes a German, head blackened and camouflaged. Then others climb over; they are wearing haloes, pink tutus, jackboots, wands. They charge over. Stock film of guns blazing.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Yes! Coming to this cinema soon!

And Roger as Pip, the half-parrot, half-man, half-woman, three-quarter badger, ex-bigamist negro preacher, for whom banjo-playing was very difficult, and he never mastered it although he took several courses and went to banjo college ... er ... and everything ... don't miss it!

By the TV, which they are watching, stands a small Arab boy (Terry G) . He has electrodes fixed to him and wires stretching from a control box held by Mrs Elizabeth III. They are watching the tramps. 

Mrs Mock Tudor(Graham Chapman): Bloody repeats! 

<Direction: She presses the switch. The arab boy flinches with pain and turns and switches of the TV set.> 

Mrs Elizabeth III(Terry Jones): Yes, repeats or war films. It really makes you want to micturate. 

Mrs Mock Tudor(Graham Chapman): People on television treat the general public like idiots. 

Mrs Elizabeth III(Terry Jones): Well we 

Mrs Elizabeth III(None): are 

Mrs Elizabeth III(Terry Jones): idiots.

Mrs Mock Tudor(Graham Chapman): How? 

Mrs Elizabeth III(Terry Jones): Look! 

<Direction: Cut to Mrs Elizabeth III coming out of the front door in a fairly well-to-do mock Tudor detached house in its own grounds. She runs headlong into a tree opposite the front door. Repeat a few times. Then she rushes into a field, digs a hole three feet deep and stands in it. Cut to her standing beside a letter box. She straps on a long false nose and pokes it through the letter box. She drinks a delicate cup of tea at a posh cafÃ© and eats the whole cup. Cut to her nailing something to a lorry. The lorry starts off to reveal that she had been nailing herself to the lorry. She is dragged away. Cut to TV planners at a window, watching Mrs Elizabeth III doing silly things in a car park below them. She has a cream bun hanging from a long stick which comes out of her hat.

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Yes ... you might just as well show them the last five miles of the M2 ... they'd watch it, eh? 

<Direction: Cut to Mrs Mock Tudor and Mrs Elizabeth III watching TV. There is a film of the motorway on it, filmed from the bank beside a bridge.> 

Mrs Mock Tudor(Graham Chapman): At last they done been put on something interesting. 

Mrs Elizabeth III(Terry Jones): Oh, most interesting. 

<Direction: Cut back to the programme planners conference. reading figures> 

First Planner(Eric Idle): ... and our figures show that the motorways are extremely popular. I mean, last time we showed a repeat of the Leicester bypass our ratings gave us 97,300,912, and ITV nought. So I do feel we ought to give B roads their own series. 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): I'm sorry ... we just can't give you a bigger budget. 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): Budgie? 

<Direction: to the second planner to the senior executive> 

First Planner(Eric Idle): Why not? 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): We're not the only slice of the cake, you know. 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): Wouldn't mind a slice of cake. Nice chocolate cake ... delicious ... 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): I had a budgie once you know, amusing little chap, used to stick his head in a bell ... what was his name, now ... Joey? ... Xerxes? ... 

First Planner(Eric Idle): We could repeat them ... 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): Re-heat them? 

First Planner(Eric Idle): No, repeat them ... 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): You don't re-heat cakes. Not chocolate cakes. 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): What, repeat the cakes? 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): Mr Heath, that was the name of the budgie. 

<Direction: looking at his watch they all scramble madly to their feet> 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Oh no it isn't, I was looking at the little hand that goes round very fast ... 

All(None): Damn. Blast. 

<Direction: They sit down again reluctantly. There is a short pause.> 

First Planner(Eric Idle): I've got it. We can retitle the repeats. 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): What ... give them different names? 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Wouldn't that mean retitling them? 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): Brilliant! 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Right - all we need is new titles. And they must be damned new! 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): How about `Dad's Navy'? 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Mm, good, good. 

First Planner(Eric Idle): `Up Your Mother Next Door.' 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Even better ... 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): 'Doctor At Bee'! 

All(None): What? 

<Direction: There is a knock at the door.> 

First Planner(Eric Idle): Someone's knocking at the door. 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Quite like it - bit long, though, I think. 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): Far too long. 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): `I Married Lucy.' 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): Hasn't that been done? 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): Oh, yes, a long time ago, though, they'd never remember it. 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): `Doctor at Three'! 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): What? 

First Planner(Eric Idle): I think someone's knocking at the door. 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): That's even longer! 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): `I Married A Tree.' 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): `And Mother Makes Tree.' 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): `Doctor At Cake'! 

<Direction: Continuous knocking on the door.> 

First Planner(Eric Idle): Look! I'm not absolutely certain, but, well I do rather get the impression that there is someone actually knocking on the door at this very moment. 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): That's ridiculous. Half the programme gone. Stop lengthening it! 

<Direction: desperate> 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): `I Married A Cake'? 

<Direction: over excited> 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): `I Married Three Rabbit Jelly Moulds'! 

Third Planner(Graham Chapman): Prefer a cake ... specially chocky cake ... 

<Direction: There is by now a constant hammering. yells from outside door> 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Open the sodding door! 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): No, no. You can't say `sodding' on the television. 

<Direction: All shake their heads. The door is broken in. Enter a neo-fascist-looking security man in a wheelchair with an oriental sword through his head.> 

Chief Executive(Terry Jones): You're supposed to knock! 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Sorry, sir, but there's trouble at studio five! 

Second Planner(Michael Palin): You're in security, aren't you? 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Yes, sir. 

<Direction: triumphantly he smiles victoriously at others> 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Sir! It's the World War series in studio five - they're not taking it seriously any more. 

First Planner(Eric Idle): You're not allowed to suggest programme titles! 

<Direction: switching on a TV set> 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Look! 

<Direction: They rush to the monitor. One of them brushes the oriental sword which is through his head.> 

Security Man(Terry Gilliam): Ow! Mind me war wound! 

All(None): That's it! Very good title!

None(None): Exterior, a large, tasteful, Georgian rich person's house with extensive gardens beautifully tended, croquet hoops on the lawn - all in superb taste, nothing vulgar. The sun shines tastefully. The atmosphere is calm. Birds sing. Sound of lawnmovers and cricket in the distance. Laughter from the tennis court. Sound of gardener sharpening spades in the potting shed. Out of vision, a Red Indian struggles to free himself from the rope bonds that bind him. We hear 'Where does a dream begin' being played on a cracked record.

Mother(Eric Idle): Yes, Mansfield shot one in the antlers. 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Oh, jolly good show. Is 'Becca about? 

Mother(Eric Idle): No, she's gorn off. 

Pilot(Michael Palin): What a super woody sort of phrase. `Gorn orff'.

Mother(Eric Idle): Oh, Gervaise do sing me a song ... 

Pilot(Michael Palin): Oh, OK. 

Mother(Eric Idle): Something woody. 

<Direction: The pilot launches into a quite enormously loud rendering of `She's going to marry Yum Yum'. The impact of this on the mother causes her to have a heart attack. She dies and the song ends.> 

Pilot(Michael Palin): For ... she's going to marry Yum Yum ... oh crikey. The old song finished her orff. 

<Direction: entering> 

Father(Graham Chapman): What's urp? 

Pilot(Michael Palin): I'm afraid Mrs Vermin Jones appears to have passed orn.

Airman(Neil Innes): When does a dream exist? 

Airman(Neil Innes): The vision of you appears somehow 

Airman(Neil Innes): Impossible to resist 

Airman(Neil Innes): But I'm not imagining seeing you

Hamlet(Terry Jones): It's just that everywhere I go it's the same old thing. All anyone wants me to say is 'To be or not to be ...' 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): '... that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ...' 

<Direction: quickly> 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Yes, it's either that, or 'Oh that this too solid flesh would melt ...' 

<Direction: taking over> 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): '... would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew. Or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon 'gainst self slaughter ...' 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting really fed up. 

<Direction: picking up a skull> 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Now do the bit about 'Alas poor Yorick ...' 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I want to 

Hamlet(None): make 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): something of my life. 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): No. I don't know that bit. 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): I want to get away from all that. Be different. 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Well um ... what do you want to be? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): A private dick! 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): A private dick? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Yes, a private dick! 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Why do you want to be a private dick? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Ooh ... why does anyone want to be a private dick? Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex! 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Ah! It's the sex, is it? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Well, that's one of the things, yes. 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Yes, what's the sex problem? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Well, there's no problem. 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl on the bed and she's all ready for it. 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): No, no, it's nothing to do with that. 

<Direction: getting excited> 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): Now come on, come on, there she is, she's all ready for it. She's a real stunner, she's got great big tits, she's really well stacked and you've got her legs up against the mantelpiece. 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): All right, Mr Butler, I'll take over. 

<Direction: a distinguished-looking man in a suit enters; the psychiatrist leaves> 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Morning, Mr Hamlet. My name's Natal. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now what seems to be the problem? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist ... 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): He's ... he's not a psychiatrist. 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist. 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Well ... yes ... um, he's a kind of psychiatrist he's ... he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er ... fully qualified ... in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway the problem I believe is basically sexual is it? 

<Direction: The psychiatrist puts his head round door.> 

Psychiatrist(Graham Chapman): I asked him that! 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Get out! 

<Direction: the psychiatrist goes; to Hamlet> 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Now then, you've got the girl on the bed. You've been having a bit of a feel up during the evening. You've got your tongue down her throat. She's got both her legs up on the mantelpiece ... 

<Direction: Enter a distinguished-looking psychiatrist in a white coat. Michael, quietly and authoritatively, indicating the door> 

Third Psychiatrist(Michael Palin): Dr Natal ... out please! 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): I'm talking to a patient! Oh ... 

<Direction: he goes> 

Third Psychiatrist(Michael Palin): Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir. We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks match. I've got a copy of 'Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if you'd like to ask me any questions about psychiatry, I bet I can answer them. 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): No, no, it's all right, really. 

Third Psychiatrist(Michael Palin): OK, you've got this girl on your bed, you've had a few drinks, you've got her stretched out and her feet on the mantelpiece ... 

<Direction: the intercom buzzes> 

Third Psychiatrist(Michael Palin): yes, what is it? 

Intercom Voice(Carol Cleveland): There's a proper psychiatrist to see you, Dr Rufus Berg. 

Third Psychiatrist(Michael Palin): Oh, oh my God! Ok, thank you. 

<Direction: he hurriedly changes into a police constable's uniform exits hurriedly A fourth psychiatrist rushes in.> 

Fourth Psychiatrist(Terry Gilliam): Right you've got the girl down on the bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece. 

<Direction: Two men in white coats bundle him out. Dr Natal Enters.> 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Well, well done, Mr Hamlet. You've done extremely well in our disorientation tests. 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Oh? Oh! 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a little, but we do this to try to establish a very good doctor/patient relationship, you see ... we do it to sort of, as it were, to break down the barriers. All right? 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): Yes fine. 

Dr Natal(Eric Idle): Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece ... 

<Direction: The two men come in and chase him out. Cut to a man at a consultant's desk in a smart West End surgery. CAPTION: 'DR BRUCE GENUINE, CHAIRMAN OF THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'> 

Dr Bruce(Terry Jones): On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating the danger of unqualified impostors. 

<Direction: Cut to Hamlet in an office. A big, impressive-looking computer beside him. in tinny computer voice You've had your tongue down her throat and she's got her legs on the mantelpiece. The door opens and a nurse appears.> 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): Out! 

<Direction: The computer scuttles for the door, revealing that underneath it are six pairs of legs, in pin-striped trousers and expensive shoes. Cut to the same computer in a field. The nurse picks up a bazooka. The computer rises into the air, the nurse fires at it and it explodes. 'Nationwide' type music and credits. Michael Charlton in a studio.> 

Charlton(Eric Idle): Good evening and welcome to 'Nationwide'. The programme where we do rather wet things nationally and also give you the chance to see some rather wet items in the Regions. Well, everyone is talking about the Third World War which broke out this morning. But here on 'Nationwide' we're going to get away from that a bit and look instead at the latest theory that sitting down regularly in a comfortable chair can rest your legs. It sounds very nice doesn't it, but can it be done? Is it possible or practical for many of us in our jobs and with the sort of busy lives we lead to sit down in a comfortable chair just when we want? We sent our reporter John Dull to find out. 

<Direction: Cut to Dull sitting in a chair on Westminster Bridge.> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I arrived here by train at about 8:50, it's now 9:05, so I've been here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I must say that my legs do feel rested. 

<Direction: A policeman walks up to him.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Is this your chair? 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Er ... well, no, it's a prop. 

Policeman(Michael Palin): It's been stolen! 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): What? 

Policeman(Michael Palin): This belongs to a Mrs Edgeworth of Pinner - she's standing over there. 

<Direction: Cut to worried middle-aged lady, standing on the other side of the road, peering across. She has an identical chair in one hand.> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a prop which the BBC ... aaargh! 

<Direction: The policeman pushes the reporter off and picks up the chair.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): It's got her name on the bottom. 

<Direction: he indicates: Mrs E. Edgeworth> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Well er ... perhaps you'd better give it back to her. 

Policeman(Michael Palin): You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you? 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Yes I do! 

Policeman(Michael Palin): What am I wearing on my head? 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): A helmet 

<Direction: correcting him> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): A policeman's helmet! 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Yes. 

<Direction: taking off his helmet and demonstrating> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): You see that? 

Policeman(Michael Palin): That little number there? 

Policeman(Michael Palin): That is a Metropolitan Area Identification Code. No helmet is authentic without that number. 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): I see. 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Kids helmets, helmets you get in toy shops, helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on. 

<Direction: he turns and crosses the busy road> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Oh could I ... 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Hang on! 

<Direction: He goes across to Mrs Edgeworth, and tries to grab the other chair from her. Mrs Edgeworth resists. He clouts her and pulls the chair away. He brings it back across the road and sits down next to the reporter.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Mind you I didn't join the police force just to wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet, but not such a nice helmet. 

<Direction: Mrs Edgeworth is gesticulating; another policeman comes up and drags her away> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): This helmet, I think, beats even some of the more elaborate helmets worn by the Tsar's private army, the so-called Axi red warriors. You know about them? 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Well, no I don't. 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got any paper? 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Well only these scripts. 

<Direction: The policeman gets up, looks up the street, and selects a businessman with a briefcase, who is hurrying away from him. The policeman runs up to him, grabs his arm, twists it up behind his back and wrenches the briefcase from his hand. He opens it, gets out some paper, then drops briefcase before the amazed owner, and ambles back to his chair, neatly grabbing a pen from a passer-by's inside pocket.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): I'll have that! 

Man(None): I say! 

<Direction: The policeman sits down again and starts to draw, talking the while.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold - and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason the Tsar was so unpopular - three gold bands surmounted by a golden eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh? 

Policeman(Michael Palin): I think the domed helmet wins every time over the flattened job, you know, even when they're three cornered ... 

<Direction: suddenly his eyes light on two office secretaries opening their packed lunch on a nearby seat> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): ... you want something to eat? 

<Direction: sensing what's going to happen, hurriedly> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): Well no, er really ... 

<Direction: approaching the girls and getting out his notebook> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Hang on. You can't park here you know. 

<Direction: bewildered We're not parked!> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): No parked! What's that then? 

Women(None): That's our lunch. 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Right. I'm taking that in for forensic examination. 

Women(None): Why? 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Because it might have been used as a murder weapon, that's why! 

<Direction: the girls look at each other; the policeman grabs their lunch to the reporter> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Beer? 

<Direction: desperately> 

Reporter(Graham Chapman): No, no, please ... honestly ... please ... 

<Direction: The policeman walks off. There is a crash of breaking glass. An alarm bell starts to ring. The reporter winces. The policeman walks into shot again, holding two bottles of beer. He sits down, opens the beers with his teeth and hands one to reporter who is very embarrassed.> 

Policeman(Michael Palin): Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were of the modular restrained kind of type ... 

<Direction: To lyrical music the camera pans across the road, and comes across a couple making love on the pavement. Pedestrians step over them.> 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh Robert, tell me I'm beautiful. 

Robert(Michael Palin): Oh you are, you are! 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh Robert, do you mean that? 

Robert(Michael Palin): Of course I do. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): You're not just saying that because I asked you? 

Robert(Michael Palin): Of course not. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh Robert ... Robert, are you sure it doesn't put you off? 

Robert(Michael Palin): What? 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): My father wanting to come and live with us. 

Robert(Michael Palin): No, of course I don't mind your father coming to live with us. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): He wouldn't just be living with us. 

Robert(Michael Palin): What do you mean? 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Well, he finds it very difficult to get to sleep on his own, so I said he could sleep with us. 

Robert(Michael Palin): He wants to put his bed in our room? 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): No, no, of course not. 

Robert(Michael Palin): Oh good ... 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Our bed is plenty big enough for three ... 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): He'd just get into bed and go to sleep. 

Robert(Michael Palin): No. I'm not having that. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh Robert, I thought you loved me? 

Robert(Michael Palin): Well I do, but ... 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Well, he wouldn't look. 

Robert(Michael Palin): He's bound to peek. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): No, no, he wouldn't honestly. 

Robert(Michael Palin): No! No! No!! 

<Direction: Cut to the three of them in bed. Robert is in the middle. Father wears striped pyjamas, the others are nude. There is an uncomfortable silence.> 

Father(Graham Chapman): You young couple just carry on. Take no notice of me ... 

<Direction: silence; they smile half-heartedly> 

Father(Graham Chapman): I don't want to feel as though I'm getting in the way. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh no dad, you're not. 

Robert(Michael Palin): No, no. 

Father(Graham Chapman): Good. 

<Direction: Silence again.> 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Well, I think I'll get to sleep. 

Father(Graham Chapman): Are you sure? 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Oh yes, I'm a bit tired after the wedding. 

Father(Graham Chapman): Bob, what about you? 

Robert(Michael Palin): Oh yes, all right, yes. 

Father(Graham Chapman): Oh well, I seem to be O/C lights. 

<Direction: to Robert> 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Good night, darling. 

Robert(Michael Palin): Good night. 

Father(Graham Chapman): Good night! 

<Direction: He switches the light off. It is pitch dark. There is a long pause, then a strange scraping noise like a pencil being sharpened. The scraping is followed by sawing and is eventually replaced by short sharpknocking sounds. This goes on for some time.> 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Father. Father, what are you doing? 

Father(Graham Chapman): I'm making a boat. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): What? 

Father(Graham Chapman): It's the Cutty Sark. It's a model I've been making in the dark for some years now. 

Carol(Carol Cleveland): Well, wouldn't it be better with the light on? 

Father(Graham Chapman): No, no, I'm making it in the dark, that's the point. 

<Direction: There is a click. The light goes on. He looks disappointed. In his hands is a completely shapeless mass of wood and nails.> 

Father(Graham Chapman): Oh dear, not as accurate as I thought. 

Robert(Michael Palin): It's not the Cutty Sark! 

Father(Graham Chapman): Well it hasn't got its sails yet. Oh well I'll ... I'll have a look at it in the dark room in the morning. Good night. 

<Direction: grunts from the others who are already snuggling down; lights go off; silence Animated opening titles. Banging on the wall from next door.> 

Man(Terry Gilliam): Shut up! Will you shut up in there! 

<Direction: Cut to a middle-aged man with small moustache and neat pyjamas banging on the wall with what appears to be an Indian club.> 

Man(Terry Gilliam): Shut up! 

<Direction: It goes quiet next door> 

Man(Terry Gilliam): That's better. 

<Direction: He walks to a side wall and hangs his club on a hook beneath big old-fashioned art-nouveau sign clearly labelled `The Burlington Wall-banger'. He goes across to bed and gets in. In the bed are a party of four Japanese businessmen in suits with lapel badges, two lady American tourists with rain hats and cameras, three other moustached English gentlemen in pyjamas, four Tour De France riders, three Swedish businessmen, and Winston Churchill. In the corner of the room are three Tour De France bicycles. All the people ae watching TV. All in the bed are slightly tear-stained and sad, and eating popcorn and crisps, utterly absorbed. On TV we hear a Hamlet sad speech.> 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): I am myself indifferent honest, but then I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. 

<Direction: Cut to the TV set in the room. Close in on TV set to see Hamlet lying beside Ophelia, who is gazing at him intently. It is the same Hamlet we saw in the psychiatrist's scene. They are in one of those rather austere modern theatre sets.> 

Hamlet(Terry Jones): O fair Ophelia, nymph, in thy orisons, be all my sins remembered ... 

Ophelia(Connie Booth): So anyway, you've got the girl on the bed and her legs are on the mantelpiece ... 

<Direction: The nurse from the psychiatrist's office enters.> 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): Out! 

<Direction: bundles her off> 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: Ends with a poster 'Boxing Tonite! The Killer vs. The Champ. 15 Rounds'. Cut to a dressing room at Madison Square Gardens, table, chairs, towels, and the usual paraphernalia. Noise of a crowd outside. The door opens and in comes Mr Gabriello, and two assistants carrying a boxer on a stretcher. Smoke, action, excitement come in with them.> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): That was a great fight, Champ, a great fight, you hear! Oh boy, what a fight, Champ, what a great fight! You nearly had him, Champ, you nearly had him ... where's his head? 

First Assistant(None): I got it in here, Mr Gabriello. 

<Direction: He holds up a carrier bag. Gabriello goes over to it, looks inside and shouts into it.> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): You were great, Champ, d'you hear, you were great! 

<Direction: looking in the bag He's got a nasty cut over his eye.> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Yeah, I think it was a mistake him wearing spectacles. 

<Direction: gives the bag to the assistant> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Oh well, get that sewn onto his body in time for the press pictures. 

First Assistant(None): OK, Mr Gabriello. 

<Direction: to second assistant> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Wasn't he great my boy? 

<Direction: Eric> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): He was great, Mr Gabriello. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): The way he kept fighting after his head came off! 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): He was better when the head came off, Mr Gabriello. He was really dodging the guy. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Yeah, I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that first minute, he would've had the Killer worried. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Sure, Mr Gabriello. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm? 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): No! 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): OK, we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone. 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Do you realize Mr Gabriello, some of those guys out there paid over $2,000 for a ringside seat. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): And where did the head land? Right at the back, that's justice... 

<Direction: the door opens; a black cleaner comes in> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): What d'you want? 

<Direction: The cleaner holds up a carrier bag.> 

Black Man(Terry Gilliam): This your boy's head? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): No, no, we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad. 

<Direction: looking in the bag> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Hey, that's Gerry Marinello. He fought the Killer last week. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): OK, give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give it to him. 

<Direction: The cleaner is ushered out.> 

Second Assistant(Eric Idle): Hey, Mr Gabriello. The press is still outside. Are you ready for them? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): How's the Champ? 

<Direction: working away with needle and thread Well, the head's on OK. But there's still a left arm missing.> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): OK, well keep the dressing gown kinda loose, OK. 

<Direction: Gabriello goes to door and opens it> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): OK boys, come on in! 

<Direction: The press surge in. The fighter is propped up.> 

First Reporter(Terry Jones): Hey Mr Gabriello, Mr Gabriello. Did you expect your boy to last the full twenty-eight seconds? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn fighter I've ever trained. 

Second Reporter(Carol Cleveland): Were you worried when his head started to come loose? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): No, no, we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to and it did. He ain't stupid. 

First Reporter(Terry Jones): Hey, can we have a word with the Champ? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple. 

First Reporter(Terry Jones): Hey Champ! How're you feeling? 

<Direction: angrily> 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): I said keep the questions simple! 

Second Reporter(Carol Cleveland): Mr Gabriello. People are saying that the kid ought to be buried. His head's come off in the last six fights. 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the top. 

Second Reporter(Carol Cleveland): Well, shouldn't he just stay in hospital? 

Mr Gabriello(Michael Palin): No, he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight next week. 

<Direction: Shot of the 'New York Times' headline 'Champ to be kept alive for big return'. Cut to a hospital ward. Numerous doctors and nurses are listening to the radio.> 

Radio Voice(Michael Palin): And there's Frank Sinatra leaving the ring. Behind him is George Raft, another great boxing fan, Martin Bormann, acknowledging the applause, and with him of course is Gus Himmler, who did an awful lot for the sport in his country in the early 1940s. And here comes the Champ now and he seems in good shape to meet the Killer once again. Before an audience, some of them will have paid $920,000 million for the privilege of seeing this boy get beaten up. And there's the bell. 

<Direction: Having a heart attack on the bed in the corner Aaarghhh! Quiet!!> 

Radio Voice(Michael Palin): And a left and a right and a right jab that's taken the Champ's shoulder off. And here's the Killer again with a right and another left and a bash with a hammer and a terrific smack with a heavy thud right into the skull and there's a gaping hole right through the Champ's body now. And now the Killer's working on the cut eye with a series of beautifully placed punches and the head's coming loose. 

<Direction: the doctors and nurses getting increasingly excited everyone cheers pandemonium breaks out in the ward - some patients cheering, doctors thumping them in disagreement general disappointment; someone changes channels> 

Second Radio Voice(Terry Jones): Well here in London it's 12:30 and time for 'The Robinsons'. 

<Direction: everyone perks up sings 'Archers' theme tune> 

Second Radio Voice(Terry Jones): da di da di da di da ... and so on. 

<Direction: on radio on radio Morning Mrs Non-Robinson. Been shopping? No, ... I've been shopping. During this exchange there have been six cuts to close-ups of radios of different shapes and sizes. What'd you buy? Pull out to reveal a pepperpot. Mrs Non-Gorilla sitting beside a radio on a park bench. A piston engine. What d'you buy that for? It was a bargain.> 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): Bloody rubbish. 

<Direction: she turns the radio off Quick cut to a hospital, doctor on a bed listening to a radio. It switches off.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): I wanted to listen to that! 

<Direction: Cut back to Mrs Non-Gorilla. Another pepperpot approaches.> 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): Morning Mrs Gorilla. 

Mrs Gorilla(Michael Palin): Morning Mrs Non-Gorilla. 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): Have you been shopping? 

Mrs Gorilla(Michael Palin): No ... been shopping. 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): Did you buy anything? 

Mrs Gorilla(Michael Palin): A piston engine! 

<Direction: She reveals a six-cylinder car engine on a white tray, on a trolley.> 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): What d'you buy that for? 

Mrs Gorilla(Michael Palin): Oooh! It was a bargain. 

<Direction: Start to pan away from them, their voices become fainter.> 

Mrs Non-Gorilla(Eric Idle): Oooohhh! 

<Direction: Pan across a civic park, of which the only occupants are about ten pepperpots, dressed identically, scattered across on benches. One pepperpot is in a wheelchair. We come in to Mrs Non-Smoker, unwrapping a parcel and calling to the birds.> 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): Come on little birdies ... come on little birdies ... tweet tweet ... come and see what mummy's got for you ... 

<Direction: She unwraps the parcel revealing a leg of lamb which she hurls at the gathered birds. A screech. She kills a pigeon. She reaches in a another bag and produces two tins of pineapple chunks and throws them.> 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): Come on little birdies ... tweety tweety ... oooh look at this ... tweet tweet ... ooohhh nice one ... come on little birdies ... 

<Direction: She chortles with delight as she hurls a huge jar of mayonnaise which smashes messily. She then throws a large frozen turkey, a jar of onions, a bag of frozen peas, and a bottle of wine. We widen as Mrs Smoker, with an identical piston engine to the last pepperpot, comes up to Mrs Non-Smoker. Quite a large area in front of Mrs Non-Smoker is littered with packaged foods and dead birds; a bird is pecking at a tin of pate; a small pond in front of her has a swan upside down with its feet sticking in the air, a huge tin floating beside it.> 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): Oohh hello, Mrs Smoker. 

Mrs Smoker(Graham Chapman): Hello Mrs Non-Smoker. 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): What, you been shopping then? 

Mrs Smoker(Graham Chapman): Nope ... I've been shopping!

Mrs Smoker(Graham Chapman): Right. Thank you. 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): How d'you cook it? 

Mrs Smoker(Graham Chapman): You don't cook it. 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): You can't eat that raw! 

Mrs Smoker(Graham Chapman): Ooooh ... never thought of that. Oh, day and night, but this is wondrous strange ... 

Mrs Non-Smoker(Terry Jones): ... and therefore is a stranger welcome it. There are more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come, the time is out of joint. Oh cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right. Let's go together.

Dentist(Terry Jones): Well over here at Epsom, there are chances a-plenty for those who want to make a good start in...

<Direction: Cut to a housewife in a back garden standing in front of a washing line with really nasty stained washing on it: some man's trousers with very nasty stain on crotch and running down the leg, a badly torn sheet with melted chocolate bisquit stuck on it, a huge bra, with cups eighteen inches across, two pieces of streaky bacon and a fried egg pegged on the line, and more dirty washing. CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM EPSOM'>

Property Dealer(Michael Palin): Well here in High Street Epsom, There are ample opportunities for all kinds of redevelopment. As you can see, 

<Direction: he indicates old houses> 

Property Dealer(Michael Palin): behind me now there are a high level of low density consumer units, still not fully maximizing site value. This could be radically improved by a carefully planned programme of demolition. And of course most of the occupants ere...er...elderly folks, so they wouldn't put up much of a fight. 

<Direction: Cut to Epsom racecourse, and a presenter, Brian McThighbone, up against the paddock rail.>

<Direction: Cut back to the presenter in the studio; he is completely dressed as Queen Victoria, apart from his face.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well a very exciting race there at Epsom. And now over to the European Cup at Barcelona where the latest news is that Miguel Otana, the burly Real Madrid striker, was sent off for breaking wind in the forty-third minute. He'd already been cautioned for pursing his lips earlier on in the game and now he's off! So let's see a playback of that ... Brian. 

<Direction: Cut to Brian, dressed the same way.> 

Brian(Eric Idle): Yes ... er ... well as you can see ... there's Otana now 

<Direction: brief stock shot of football match cut back to Brian> 

Brian(Eric Idle): and er ... he makes no attempt to play the ball. He quite deliberately lets off! And to my mind he was within the box and the referee had no option whatsoever but to send him off. 

<Direction: Cut to the presenter.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Jimmy? 

<Direction: We cut to the real Jimmy Hill dressed as Queen Victoria, veil, crown and all. Good evening.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): What do you make of that? 

Jimmy Hill(None): Well the referees really are clamping down these days. Only last week the Belgian captain was sent off for having a Sony radio cassette player. And Gonerelli, the huge Italian defender, was sent off in Turin for having his sitting and dining room knocked through to form an open living area.

Fade out. Fade up on a moor. An explosion has just take place. Out of the smoke a ragged man walks towards the camera.> 

Man(Michael Palin): And then... 

<Direction: Animated titles.> 

None(None): A street in Ruislip, morning. A scrap cart is going down the street. 

Scrap Man(Terry Jones): Let's bring 'em out! Any old iron! Any old iron! 

<Direction: A door opens and a homewife brings out a rather sophisticated-looking ground-to-air missile system, and dumps it on the cart.> 

Scrap Man(Terry Jones): Thank you. 

<Direction: Another door opens and a couple of rather respectable-looking old ladies bring out two bazookas and assorted shells and put them by the gate. There are further contributions of arms from householders. A GPO van comes up the street, passes the scrap cart and comes to rest up by the camera. There is a pillar box with a cover on it on the pavement, plus a rostrum with PA and bunting. A lord mayor is ushered out of the van by a post office official. The mayor and several ladies sit on the rostrum. Clearing his throat, the GPO official gets up, tests the microphone and starts to speak in a slightly strange voice.> 

GPO Official(Michael Palin): We are here today to witness the opening of a new 

GPO Official(None): box 

GPO Official(None): boxes 

<Direction: a moment's pause boÃ®te boÃ®tes> 

GPO Official(Michael Palin): Wir kommen hier heute Morgen fÃ¼r die Einfang auf dem neue Kabinett fÃ¼r die Poste. 

<Direction: The first two sentences of the next voice over are laid over the end of the French speech.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): A perfectly ordinary morning in a perfectly ordinary English suburb. Life goes on as it has done for years. 

<Direction: Cut to a suburban railway station.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But soon this quiet pattern of life was to change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday morning would never be the same again, for into this quiet little community came ... Mr Neutron! 

<Direction: A train stops at the station. The train doors open and out steps Mr Neutron. He looks like an American footballer, with enormous shoulders, tapering to a thin waist. He has very regular features and piercing eyes and is most impressive. He stands at the door of the train for a moment. The words 'Mr Neutron' are written in bold diagonally across his chest. He carries a Sainsbury's shopping bag.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Mr Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy the world. 

<Direction: animation of planets in space> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Mr Neutron. No one knows what strange and distant planet he came from, or where he was going to!... Wherever he went, terror and destruction were sure to follow. 

<Direction: Cut to Neutron's garden. He has three little picnic chairs out and is having tea with Mr and Mrs Entrail, a middle-aged couple. The lady, a little overdressed dominates. Mr Entrail sits there rather sourly.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Mr Neutron! The man whose incredible power has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment to destroy this little world utterly! 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley... 

<Direction: in a strange disembodied voice, grammatically correct but poor in intonation> 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Shirley who used to be the hairdresser? 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): Yes, that's right, I think she's a lovely person. 

<Direction: indicates her husband> 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): My husband doesn't ... he thinks she's a bit flash. 

Mr Entrail(Terry Jones): I hate 'er! I hate 'er guts. 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): And they, of course, they come down most weekends, so you'll be able to meet them then. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): l'd ... love ... to. Hairdressing is very interesting. 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): And very important, too. If you don't care for your scalp, you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth, he's our youngest. Mind you, he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband thinks he is, anyway. 

Mr Entrail(Terry Jones): Nasty little piece of work, he is, I hate him! 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): Mind you, the one we hear so much about nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they live in Alberta - two lovely children, Gary who's three, Leslie who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to see a photo ... ? 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Oh, yes please. 

Mrs Entrail(Michael Palin): All right. 

<Direction: She goes to get a photograph.> 

Mr Entrail(Terry Jones): They're a couple of little bastards. I hate 'em. They've got eyes like little pigs, just like their mother. She's a disaster ... a really horrible-looking person, she is. I thought that one would stay on the shelf, but along comes this stupid dentist git. He's a real creepy little bastard, he is. I hate 'im. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): This is a nice area. 

Mr Entrail(Terry Jones): It's like a bloody graveyard. I hate it. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): It's handy for the shops and convenient for the West End. 

Mr Entrail(Terry Jones): If you like going to the West End. I think it's a stinking dump. 

<Direction: Cut to a well-guarded American government building, with the letters 'FEAR' on a board outside.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Meanwhile in Washington, at the headquarters of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and Extermination Centre... all was not well. 

<Direction: A high-security operations room - maps, charts. monitor screens. A message comes chattering over the teleprinter. A teleprinter operator rips it out and takes it over to Captain Carpenter who sits at a control desk.> 

Captain Carpenter(Eric Idle): Good God! 

<Direction: he grabs a red flashing phone> 

Captain Carpenter(Eric Idle): Get me the Supreme Commander Land, Sea and Air Forces, immediately! 

<Direction: Cut to a large room, empty apart from a very large desk with a large American eagle emblem above it. We hear American military music. There is nothing on the desk, except for a very futuristic, dynamic-looking intercom. Behind the desk the supreme commander sits. After a moment, slowly and rather surreptitiously, he sniffs his left armpit inside his jacket. Then, with a quick look around to see that no one is watching, he smells the other armpit. He sits up again, then cups his hand in front of his face to smell his breath. He looks worried still. He reaches down slowly and takes his shoe off. He has just brought it up to his nose when the intercorn buzzes loudly and a light flashes. The music stops. He jumps, and quickly takes his shoe off the desk. He presses a switch on the intercom.> 

Commander(Michael Palin): Hello? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): This is Captain Carpenter sir, from FEAR. 

Commander(Michael Palin): You mean FEEBLE? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, sir ... 

Commander(Michael Palin): What is it? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Mr Neutron is missing, sir! 

Commander(Michael Palin): Mr Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all roads! We'll bomb the town flat if we have to! 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Sir! Sir! He's not in Washington, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! Lay off! Lay off... Where is he? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): We don't know, sir ... all we know is he checked out of his hotel and took a bus to the airport. 

Commander(Michael Palin): All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with every army, navy and air force unit on eternal standby! 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Right, sir! 

Commander(Michael Palin): And introduce conscription! 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, sir! 

Commander(Michael Palin): Right! 

<Direction: He slams the intercom button down and sits there. Silence again. His eyes look from side to side then slowly he goes back to smelling himself.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): So the world was in the grip of FEAR! A huge and terrifying crisis generated by one man! 

<Direction: zoom into Neutron in his front garden, weeding; behind him the group of GPO people are sitting opening another box fifty yards further down from the first one; a line of six recently opened boxes stretches up the road> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): ... easily the most dangerous man the world has ever seen, honestly. Though still biding his time, he could strike at any moment. Could he be stopped in time? 

<Direction: A lady stops and chats to him.> 

Mrs Smailes(Eric Idle): You've got a bit of work to do there, then. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Yes, it is a problem. 

Mrs Smailes(Eric Idle): Mrs Ottershaw never used to bother ... then of course she was very old... she was 206! Well, must be going... if you need any help I'll send Frank round. He could do with a bit of'exercise, ha! ha! ha! ha! ... Fat old bastard... 

<Direction: She walks off. Neutron goes back to his weeding. Cut back to the supreme commander's office. He is sniffing himself again, only this time he has his whole shirt front pulled up and he is trying to smell under his shirt. The intercom goes. He quickly tucks his shirt in and depresses the switch.> 

Commander(Michael Palin): Yes? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Captain Carpenter here, sir. We've been on red alert now for three days, sir, and still no sign of Mr Neutron. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'em we got 

Commander(None): teeth 

Commander(Michael Palin): ? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh yes, sir. We've bombed a lot of places flat, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're chicken. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh no! They don't think that, sir. Everyone's really scared of us, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Of us? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, sir. 

<Direction: pleased> 

Commander(Michael Palin): Of our power? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh yes, sir! They're really scared when they see those big planes come over. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet they're really scared. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh they are, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Do we have any figures on how scared they are? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No ... no figures, sir. But they sure were scared. 

Commander(Michael Palin): Ah! But it's not working? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes, there's one man who could nail him. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): One guy? That won't frighten anyone, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): He's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the Yukon... ' 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): What's his name, sir? 

Commander(Michael Palin): His name is Teddy Salad. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Salad as in... ? 

Commander(Michael Palin): Lettuces, cucumber, radishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Where do I find him, sir? 

Commander(Michael Palin): The Yukon. Oh, and Carpenter ... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, sir? 

Commander(Michael Palin): Make sure you get a decent disguise. 

<Direction: Cut to the Yukon. Carpenter is trekking along. He is in ballet tights and heavy make-up with a big knapsack with 'Nothing to do with FEEBLE' on the back. He comes across a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. He presses the doorbell. A rather twee little chime. The door is opened by a huge lumberjack.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh, hello. My name's Carpenter. I'm from the US Government. 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Are you from the army? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Er... no... I'm... er... I'm... I'm from the ballet. The US Government Ballet. 

<Direction: The lumberjack's eyes light up.> 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): The ballet! The ballet's coming here? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Well maybe... 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Oh, that's great! We love the ballet. Last year some of us from Yellow River got a party to go see the ballet in Montreal. 

<Direction: Dimly we can see behind the lumberjack a bevy of beautiful boys of all nations.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Look, I was wondering... 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Oh, we had a 

Lumberjack(None): marvellous 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): time. It was Margot Fonteyn dancing 'Les Sylphides'... oh, it was so beautiful... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Do you know... 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Do you know how old she is? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Who? 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Margot Fonteyn. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No. 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): She's 206! 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Look, I hear there's a US 

Carpenter(None): ballet 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): organizer round these parts by the name of Teddy Salad. 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): You mean the special agent? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Well... 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): He's an ex-CIA man. He's not a ballet dancer. 

<Direction: Laughter from the boys in the hut.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Well, I just want to see him on some ballet business... 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Well, you could try the store... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh, thank you. 

<Direction: he turns to go> 

Lumberjack(Graham Chapman): Hey! Can you get us Lionel Blair's autograph? 

<Direction: Carpenter walks away.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): While precious time was being lost in Canada, the seconds were ticking away for the free world... 

<Direction: Jarring chord. Cut to Neutron's house. He is hanging flowery print wallpaper in his sitting room. Helping him is the quite enormously vast Frank Smailes who stands rather helplessly looking up at Neutron who is on a plank between two ladders.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Already Neutron - who, you will remember, is infinitely the most dangerous man in the world, he 

Voice Over(None): really 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): is - was gathering allies together. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Try having an omelette for your evening meal... perhaps with yogurt and grapefruit. 

Mr Smailes(Michael Palin): Oh, I've tried that ... I once got down to fifty-six stone. But I couldn't stay like that. I used to take potatoes wherever I went. I used to go to the cinema with three hundredweight of King Edwards, I'd eat 'em all before I got out of the toilet. I had to go on to bread. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): What about salad? 

Mr Smailes(Michael Palin): Teddy Salad? 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): No, no, no - salad - as in lettuces, radishes, cucumber... 

<Direction: Cut to Carpenter in a log cabin trading post with trestle tables. Six Eskimos are sitting in a group at one end of the other tables. An Italian chef in a long white apron and greasy shirt, is standing over Carpenter. Carpenter sits at one table with a huge fresh salad in front of him.> 

Italian(Michael Palin): You don't like it? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No, I didn't want to 

Carpenter(None): eat 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): a salad. I wanted to find out about a man called Salad. 

Italian(Michael Palin): You're the first person to order a salad for two years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish, fish ... 

<Direction: very British accent not> 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Eskimos. 

Second Eskimo(Terry Jones): Where's our fish. We've finished our fish. 

Italian(Michael Palin): What fish you want today, uh? 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Bream please. 

Italian(Michael Palin): Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? You bloody choosy Eskimo pests. 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): We are 

First Eskimo(None): not 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Eskimos! 

Italian(Michael Palin): Why don't you like a nice plate of canelloni? 

Eskimos(None): Eurrrrghhh! 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): That's not fish. 

<Direction: as he turns to go in kitchen> 

Italian(Michael Palin): I've had my lot of the Arctic Circle. I wish I was back in Oldham ... 

<Direction: Carpenter crosses to the Eskimos. speaking slowly, and clearly as for foreigners> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Do any of you Eskimos ... speak ... English? 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): We're not Eskimos! 

Third Eskimo(None): I am. 

Others(None): Sh! 

<Direction: off> 

Italian(Michael Palin): Haddock! 

Eskimos(None): Where? 

<Direction: still speaking as if to foreigners> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Do any of... you ... know... a man ... called ... Salad? 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): What, Salad as in... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes ... yes. 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Like you have on your plate? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes. That's right. 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): No, I'm afraid not. 

Second Eskimo(Terry Jones): Where's our fish? 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): What does this Teddy Salad do? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): He's a... er... hen-teaser. 

<Direction: Quick cut to the chairman of Fiat in his office.> 

Chairman(Eric Idle): Che cosa Ã¨ la stucciacatori di polli? 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'WHAT IS A HEN-TEASER?' 

<Direction: Cut back to the cabin.> 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): No, the only Teddy Salad we know is a CIA man. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Oh, he might know. 

<Direction: chanting Gunga gunga, where's our fish?> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Where will I find him? 

Second Eskimo(Terry Jones): Oh, he lives up at Kipper Sound. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Thanks a lot. 

Eskimos(None): Fishy fishy iyoooiyooo. 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Are you in international spying, too? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No... no... I'm with the... US Ballet... force... who are you with? 

<Direction: leans forward confidentialy> 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): MI6. But not a word to the Eskimos. 

Eskimos(None): Fishy fishy igooo. 

<Direction: The Italian chef appears.> 

Italian(Michael Palin): Here's your bloody fish. 

First Eskimo(Graham Chapman): Thank you, Anouk. 

Italian(Michael Palin): I'm not an Eskimo! 

<Direction: Cut to Arctic wastes - ice and snow and bitter blasting winds. Carpenter - his little tadger tiny as a tapir's tits - struggles on. He stops and peers ahead He sees a trapper figure with a sled pulled by four huskies. Carpenter hurries on and catches him up.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Hey! Hey! 

<Direction: The man stops. On his sled are supplies including two ladies in bikinis, deep-frozen and wrapped in cellophane bags.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Hi! I'm Carpenter of the US Ballet. 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Hey, great to have you around. The last decent ballet we got around here was Ballet Ramben..On Thursday they did 'Petrouchka', then on Saturday they did 'Fille Mal GardÃ©e'. I thought it was a bit slow... 

<Direction: stopping him short> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): It sure is nice to see you, Mr Salad. 

Trapper(Terry Jones): I ain't Salad. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): What? 

Trapper(Terry Jones): You want Teddy Salad? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yeah ... 

<Direction: the man looks around rather furtively, to see if anyone is watching, then takes Carpenter's arm and indicates the dog team> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): I don't see anyone. 

Trapper(Terry Jones): The one on the end, on the right. That's Salad. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): That's a dog! 

<Direction: confidentially bits> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): of it. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): What do you mean? 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Listen, Teddy Salad is the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had, right? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Right. 

Trapper(Terry Jones): That's how he made his name 

<Direction: indicates the dog> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): - disguise! 

<Direction: They look at the dog in silence for a moment.> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): That's incredible! 

Trapper(Terry Jones): He had to slim down to one and a half pounds to get into that costume. He cut eighteen inches off each arm and over three feet off each leg. The most brilliant surgeon in Europe stuck that tail on. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): What about the head? 

Trapper(Terry Jones): All of the head was removed apart from the eyes and the brain in order to fit into the costume. 

Trapper(Terry Jones): D'you want to talk to him? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yeah, sure. 

<Direction: looking around him again> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): OK, let's move over to those trees over there... anyone might be watching. 

<Direction: They pull over to a lone deciduous tree in the middle of the empty tundra wastes. They pull in. The man goes round to the dog and kneels down beside it. softly> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Mr Salad? ... There's Mr Carpenter to see you. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): What does he say? 

<Direction: to Carpenter Carpenter feels rather helplessly in his pockets he produces a bone, which he gives to the dog the dog tucks into the bone> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): All right, you've got his trust, now, you can talk to him. 

<Direction: kneeling rather awkwardly down beside the dog, and speaking confidentially he looks significantly at the dog, but the dog doesn't react> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): The General says you're the only one who'll know where to find him ... What's he say? 

Trapper(Terry Jones): He wants to go walkies. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Walkies? 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Yeah, he's right into it today - d'you mind taking him for walkies? 

<Direction: He gives the dog to Carpenter on a lead. Carpenter hesitates and then walks off with the dog, bending down occasionally and explaining the situation.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had for walkies, events in the world's capitals were moving fast! 

<Direction: Cut to a picture of the outside of l0 Downing Street. Zoom in on the door. Music: 'Rule Britannia' type theme. Cut to interior - a few circular tables, dim lighting. The decor of a rather exclusive restaurant. Subdued murmur of upper-class people stuffing their faces. A gypsy violinist is going from table to table playing and singing. In the middle of all this there is the prime minister at a big leather-topped desk, covered with official papers, three telephones, an intercom, tape recorder, a photo of Eisenhower with a very small bunch of flowers in front of it in a sort of self-contained shrine, an in/out tray, blotter, etc. The intercom buzzes. The Secretary of State to see you, Prime Minister.> 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): Very well, show him in. 

<Direction: The prime minister switches off. The secretary of state enters, wending his way through the tables. He sits at the desk. He is in a rather agitated condition.> 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Prime Minister. 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): Do take a seat. 

<Direction: He takes a seat from the next table; the lady sitting on it falls to the floor.> 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Prime Minister, we've just had the Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a full-scale Red Alert! 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): They what? 

<Direction: The gypsy violinist has come round to the desk. He is playing a sad, slow melody and smiling encouragingly at them. They glance at him. He flashes a white smile. The secretary of state drops his voice and huddles closer to the prime minister.> 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): They want a full-scale Red Alert - every troop movement... 

<Direction: As the secretary leans forward so does the gypsy, musing the secretary to break off in mid-sentence.> 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): It's all right - don't worry about Giuseppe... 

<Direction: the secretary looks at the gypsy who smiles again toothily> 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): He's English really. 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Well apparently the whole structure of world peace may be threatened unless we immediately... 

<Direction: heavy accent, leaning forwards> 

Giuseppe(Terry Jones): Your anniversary, signore? 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): No, no, Giuseppe - not now. 

<Direction: indicating the secretary of state> 

Giuseppe(Terry Jones): You mean zis isn't ze lady? 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): No. 

Giuseppe(Terry Jones): Oh, signora ... my mistake! I play for you 'My Mistake'. 

<Direction: before the prime minister can stop him he goes into a strident Italian song strums violently and starts on the second verse> 

Giuseppe(Terry Jones): 'Oh my mistake...' 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): Giuseppe, do you mind playing over there. 

<Direction: flashing a winning smile> 

Giuseppe(Terry Jones): Very well, signor. But I play only for you... and your beautiful companion. 

<Direction: He moves off mysteriously, singing the mistake song.> 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Well anyway, this Mr Neutron, is located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate him. The Americans say if we don't, they will. 

<Direction: straining to hear over noise of singing> 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): What? 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): The Americans say if we won't 

Secretary of State(None): they 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): will! 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): That he doesn't know 

Prime Minister(None): what 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): ? 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): They'll bomb the entire London area. 

<Direction: getting up he grabs the photo of Eisenhower> 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): They won't bomb 

Secretary of State(None): here 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): . 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): Are you sure? 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Sure. 

<Direction: sitting down with great relief> 

Prime Minister(Eric Idle): Right. When are they going to start? 

Secretary of State(Michael Palin): Well apparently they haven't got Neutron yet... but when they do... 

<Direction: The diners have by this time joined a conga led by the gypsy violinist playing 'My Mistake'. Awfully heartily they dance past the prime minister's desk. Cut to Artic wastes. The wind howls. The trapper is sitting beside a fire, picking his nose thoughtfully and tending a stewpan. The dog bounds back, Carpenter on the end of his lead, breathless from trying to keep up.> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Well. Did he tell you anything? 

<Direction: worn out by the walk> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No ... we chased sticks ... we chased a few reindeer... 

<Direction: patting the dog> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): You been chasing reindeer, have you? You're a naughty boy... yes... ain't you a naughty boy... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Look, we haven't got much time ... He hasn't given me any information yet... 

Trapper(Terry Jones): OK. Tell you what, let's eat. You give him one of your meatballs, he'll tell you anything... OK? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): OK. 

<Direction: Suddenly the dog woofs, gets up on back legs and starts pawing the trapper.> 

Trapper(Terry Jones): Wait a minute - he's trying to tell us something. 

<Direction: A strangled, strained American voice comes from within the dog. Slightly muffled perhaps.> 

Dog(Michael Palin): Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter... 

<Direction: kneeling down and peering into the dog's face> 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, Mr Salad? Can you hear me? 

Dog(Michael Palin): Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in here... what's the problem? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): It's Mr Neutron, sir ... he's gone missing. The Supreme Commander wants you to take charge. 

Dog(Michael Palin): I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes, Mr Salad? 

Dog(Michael Palin): I gotta go walkies again. 

<Direction: Cut to the office of the supreme commander. He is now nude behind his desk. A kidney bowl full of water is on desk; he is dabbing at himself with a sponge. The intercom buzzes. He switches it on. Still no sign of Captain Carpenter, sir... or Mr Neutron.> 

Commander(Michael Palin): OK. We'll bomb Neutron out. Get me Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin, Isle of Wight! 

<Direction: Cut to stock film of B52s on a bombing raid.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. They bombed Cairo, Bangkok, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Harrow, Hammersmith, Stepney, Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was the wrong place. 

<Direction: Cut to an area of smoking rubble. A van with the words 'US Air Force' on the side trundles through the rubble. It has a loudspeaker on the top of it.> 

Loudspeaker(Eric Idle): Sorry Enfield!... We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our bombing... sorry... 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): But what of Mr Neutron, the most fearfully dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire galaxies with his wrist, the man who could tear fruit machines apart with his eyeballs... He had not been idle! 

<Direction: Meantime we have mixed through to Neutron's suburban sitting room. He is standing in the doorway gazing at something off camera. He holds an envelope which he has just opened and a letter.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady who 'does' for Mrs Entrail... 

<Direction: The camera pans across to a slovenly char in paisley apron, furry slippers and head scarf. Throughout this scene we hear the sound of bombers and the distant muffled sound of explosions.> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh 'ello Mr N, terrible about Enfield, innit? It's all gone. So's Staines ... lovely shops they used to have in Staines... and Stunmore, where the AA offices used to be. I don't know where we'll pay our AA subscriptions to now. Do you know where we'll have to pay our AA. subscriptions to now, Mr N? 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I didn't know you were a member of the AA Mrs S.C.U.M. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh yes. Ever since the Corsair broke down in Leyonstone ... they towed it all the way to Deauville FOC. 

<Direction: Mr Neutron looks blank> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Free of Charge. Well my husband Ken, K.E.N., he said... 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Oh, forget about your husband, Mrs S.C.U.M. - or may I call you Mrs S? 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): You can call me Linda, if you like. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): No, I'd rather call you Mrs S. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh... 

<Direction: as if trying to soften the blow> 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): And you can call me Mr N. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Well... that's what I was calling you. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Mrs S, there is something I have to tell you... 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Yes, Mr N? 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I have just won a Kellogg's Corn Flake Competition. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh Mr N! That's wonderful! 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I got the ball in exactly the right place. The prize is Â£5,000 in cash, or as much ice cream as you can eat. 

<Direction: Her eyes go round as saucers and all thoughts of returning to her marital bed vanish under the impact of such imminent wealth.> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Â£5,000! 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I was thinking of taking the ice cream. 

<Direction: alarmed> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh no! 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): It's been so hot recently. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): You couldn't eat that much ice cream Mr N. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Mrs S, I can eat enormous quantifies of ice cream without being sick. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh no! Take the Â£5,000! Please take the Â£5,000. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I was thinking. If we got married... 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh yes! 

<Direction: she sits very close to him> 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): We could use the Â£5,000 to buy a spoon... 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh! We could buy a lot more than that! 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): And then fill up with ice cream. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): No! Forget about the ice cream. We need the money. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): We need nothing. For there is something I have not told you Mrs S.C.U.M. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh please call me Mrs S. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): No I would rather go back to calling you Mrs S.C.U.M., Mrs S.C.U.M. I am the most powerful man in the universe. There is nothing I cannot do. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh Mr N. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I want you to be my helpmate. As Tarzan had his Jane, as Napoleon had his Josephine, as Frankie Laine had whoever he had, I want you to help me in my plan to dominate the world! 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh Mr N. That I should be so lucky! 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): You're not Jewish are you? 

<Direction: Cut back to the Yukon. The trapper, Captain Carpenter and the dog are still sitting round the dying campfire over the remains of supper. They are all looking a little bit bored. The dog has obviously been telling long reminiscences.> 

Dog(Michael Palin): Another time when I was in Cairo, I was disguised as a water hydrant. The whole top part of my head had been removed and... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Please, Mr Salad .... you must tell us where Neutron is. 

Dog(Michael Palin): And I functioned! D'you hear? I really worked. I could put out a fire. 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Please, Mr Salad... 

Dog(Michael Palin): Mind you, it hurt a bit... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Please, Mr Salad - there isn't much time. Where will we find Neutron? 

Dog(Michael Palin): OK. Give me another meatball and I'll tell you. 

<Direction: Carpenter grabs a meatball and throws it down for the dog. The dog wolfs it. Carpenter and Trapper exchange glances. Carpenter bends nearer the dog. The dog finishes the meatball with much slurping. Carpenter crouches beside him patiently.> 

Dog(Michael Palin): OK listen carefully... I won't repeat this. You understand? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yes yes - quick. 

Dog(Michael Palin): I know where Neutron is right now. I know the exact address and the exact house and the exact road... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): OK where is he? 

Dog(Michael Palin): He's not in America... 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): No? 

Dog(Michael Palin): He's not in... Asia! 

Dog(Michael Palin): He's not in.., Australia! 

Dog(Michael Palin): He's in... Europe! 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yeah? 

Dog(Michael Palin): And you wanna know where in Europe? 

Carpenter(Eric Idle): Yeah! 

Dog(Michael Palin): OK. OK, I'll tell you. He's in England... In London... at Number 19... 

<Direction: A sudden explosion completely engulfs them. Cut to the supreme commander's offce. He is still nude and has an enormous display of talcs and powders on his desk. He is talking to the intercom.> 

Commander(Michael Palin): OK. That's the Yukon - what's left? 

Voice(None): Only Ruislip, the Gobi Desert, and your office, sir. 

Commander(Michael Palin): OK! Let's start with my office. 

<Direction: a big explosion Cut to the Gobi Desert. Sweltering heat. We come onto a group opening a GPO box. There is a line of boxes stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see. Arabic is being spoken by the GPO official.> 

GPO Official(Michael Palin): Ankwat i odr inkerat Gobi Desert Ulverston Road... 

None(None): SUBTITLE: 'THIS NEW BOX COMPLETES THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF THE GOBI DESERT'

<Direction: A terrific explosion. Cut to Neutron and Mrs Scum.> 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): I will take you away from all this Mrs S.C.U.M. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh, Mr N... I'd follow you anywhere. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): We will have two weeks in Benidorm. 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh yes ... yes. 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): And I will make you the most beautiful woman in the world. 

<Direction: He stretches out his hands towards her. His piercing eyes narrow in concentration. There is a flash, a jump cut, and Mrs S stands before him as dumpy and unattractive as ever, but in a brand new C & A twin set and pearls, a nice new handbag, and a rather fussy hat.> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Oh... it's beautiful... oh, Mr N, you have made my heart sing... 

<Direction: quick cut to stock film of bomber then back to Mrs Scum quick flash of bomber then back to Mrs Scum> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): Life's rich harvest is being... 

Mr Neutron(Graham Chapman): Shut up, Mrs S. We must hurry... 

<Direction: He takes her hand and pulls her away.> 

Mrs Scum(Terry Jones): I'd better leave a note for Ken... he'll be expecting us... 

<Direction: explosion> 

None(None): ANIMATION: 

<Direction: the world destroyed and burning.> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Has Mr Neutron escaped in time? Is the world utterly destroyed? How can Mr Neutron and his child bride survive? Will his mighty powers be of any avail against the holocaust? Stay tuned to this channel. 

<Direction: Cut to a man in a grey suit in a studio.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Hello. Well in fact what happens is that they are saved by Mr Neutron's mighty powers just as the last bomb falls on Ruislip. 

None(None): SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A MAN FROM THE "RADIO TIMES"' 

Man(Eric Idle): However, the Earth has been blown off its axis, and in a most dramatic and dangerous and expensive sequence, it spins off into space. There are appallingly expensive scenes of devastation and horror and the final incredibly expensive climax is reached as thousands of ape monsters in very expensive costumes descend from the sky onto these, plug up a whole city which has to be specially built and fling them all into the sea very expensively. And we can see those very expensive scenes right now. 

<Direction: the credits start on his TV set> 

Man(Eric Idle): Just after the credits have gone through... incidentally, these are going to be the most expensive and lavish scenes ever filmed by the BBC in conjunction with Time-Life of course ... these are some of the technical people who have been involved in filming these very expensive scenes, expensive sound, expensive visual effects there, expensive production assistant, expensive designer... cheap director. Well you can see those expensive scenes right now. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'THE END' 

<Direction: voice over> 

Man(Eric Idle): Oh come on you can give us another minute, Mr Cotton, please. 

None(None): CAPTION: 'CONJURING TODAY' 

<Direction: Fade up on a conjurer with a fright wig and ping-pong eyes. He holds a bloodstained saw.> 

Conjurer(Michael Palin): Good evening, last week we learned how to saw a lady in half. This week we're going to learn how to saw a lady into three bits and dispose of the body... 

<Direction: Two policemen chase him off the set. They run past the man from the previous announcement who is on the phone. On his TV set we see the policemen pursuing the conjurer.> 

Man(Eric Idle): Look if you can put on rubbish like that, and 'Horse of the Year Show', you can afford us another minute, Mr Cotton, please, I mean look at this load of old... 

<Direction: fades out Fade up on the entrance to TV Centre. The man walks out.> 

Voice Over(Eric Idle): World Domination t-shirts are available from BBC, World Domination Department, Cardiff. 

<Direction: A man (Terry J) hits him on the head with an absolutely enormous hammer. He falls, stunned. Fade out. CAPTION: 'A PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST ON BEHALF OF THE LIBERAL PARTY'> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Party... 

<Direction: Cut to a kitchen. Mr Garibaldi is eating a packet of 'Ano-Weet'. On the back of the packet in big letters it reads 'Free Inside - The Pope + Demonstration Record'. Kevin Garibaldi is stretched out the whole length of the sofa, eating a huge plate of baked beans. His father occasionally flaps the copy of the paper he is reading at him to clear the air. The paper is called 'The Scun' and has a pin-up on the front page with big headline 'What a Scorcher! Phew! Can Resist this Miss'; at the bottom of the page in small print 'China Declares War'. The banner across top reads 'In the Scun Today "Tits and Inflation"'. Ralph Garibaldi is sitting at the table eating. At one point he stretches across the table, and his arm sticks in the butter. He tries to clean it off and knocks the sugar over. There is a large photo of Ian Smith on the wall; built around it is a plaster shrine, with flowers in front of it. Mrs Garibaldi is ironing. She irons some underclothes, then she irons a transistor radio. Dotted about the room are a flat telephone, a flat standard lamp, and a flat cat. Valerie Garibaldi is wearing a shiny red miniskirt. She has bright yellow 'beehive' hair so stiffly lacquered that it is quite a hazard to various ornaments on the mantelpiece. She is continuously making herself up in the mantelpiece mirror which is shaped like a lavatory. The other member of the family is a very fat old dog. As we see all this, the football commentary is droning throughout on the radio.> 

Radio Voice(Eric Idle): Pratt... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball out to Pratt... and now Pratt is on the ball, a neat little flick back inside to Pratt, who takes it nicely and sends it through on the far side to Pratt, Pratt with it but passes instead to Pratt, Pratt again, oh and well intercepted by the swarthy little number nine, Concito Maracon. This twenty-one-year-old half back, remarkably stocky for 6' 3", square shouldered, balding giant, hair flowing in the wind, bright eyed, pert, young for his age but oh so old in so many ways. For a thirty-nine.year-old you wouldn't expect such speed. Normally considered slow, he's incredibly fast as he wanders aimlessly around, sweeping up and taking the defence to the cleaners. Who would have thought, though many expected it, that this remarkable forty-five-year-old, 9' 4" dwarf of a man, who is still only seventeen in some parts of the world, would ever really be ... Oh and there was a goal there apparently ... and now it's Pratt ... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball to Pratt... 

<Direction: crackle By now mother has succeeded in flattening the radio with the iron. She folds it neatly and puts it on the pile.> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): I like this Ano-Weet, it really unclogs me. 

<Direction: Ralph Garibaldi knocks a bowl onto the floor. It smashes.> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Oh, do be careful. 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Sorry, mum. 

<Direction: Kevin opens another can of beans and pours them on to his plate, throwing the tin on the floor. The radio drones on.> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): I mean a lot of others say they unclog you, but I never had a single bowel movement with the 'Recto-Puffs'. 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Now if we ... 

<Direction: he knocks the cereal box off the table> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Oh, sorry, mum ... Now if we lived in Rhodesia there'd be someone to mop that up for you. 

<Direction: turning from the mirror in mid make-up> 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): Don't be so bleedin' stupid. If you lived in bleedin' Rhodesia, you'd be out at bleedin' fascist rallies every bleedin' day. You're a bleedin' racist, you bleedin' are. 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Language! 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): Well he gets on my sodding wick. 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): That's better. 

<Direction: Mother is now ironing the telephone and the cat. She irons them flat and pins them on the line.> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): No, the stuff I liked was that stuff they gave us before the war, what was it - Wilkinson's Number 8 Laxative Cereal. Phew. That one went through you like a bloody Ferrari... 

<Direction: The doorbell rings.> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Now, who's that at this time of day... 

<Direction: she goes out> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): If it's the man to empty the Elsan, tell him it's in the hall. 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Right, dear. 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): And make sure that you hold it the right way up! 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Dad... ? 

<Direction: A middle-aged man appears from the broom cupboard. Yeah?> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): No no, my dad... 

Strange Man(None): Oh... 

<Direction: he gets back into the cupboard again> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?... 

<Direction: he knocks the teapot on to the floor, it smashes> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Oh sorry, dad. 

<Direction: Cut to the doorway in the hall. A man in a dark suit, very smart and well-dressed, is doing strange kung-fu antics.> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): No... no, really, thank you very much... no, thank you for calling, not today, thank you. Good morning. 

<Direction: She shuts the door on him. As she does so Mr Garibaldi shouts out to her.> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Who was that? 

<Direction: coming in again now> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): ? 

<Direction: he is standing beside the sink which has just split in two> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): I was just washing up... 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Go and sit down! 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called Rhodesia? 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Do you remember 'Go-Eazi'? They were hopeless... 

<Direction: Kevin opens another can of beans; dad notices in disgust and flaps his paper again> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): little black pellets... tasted foul and stuck inside you like flooring adhesive. 

<Direction: she has finally finished her startling make-up> 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): Right, I'm off. 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): When are you coming back tonight? 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): 3 a.m. 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): I think it's disgusting... you a Member of Parliament. 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): I heard you in the hall last night, snogging away. 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): I wasn't 

Valerie Garibaldi(None): snogging 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): ! 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Sounded like snogging to me. I could hear his great wet slobbering lips going at yer ... and his hand going up yer... 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Dad! 

<Direction: coming out of the cupboard Yes.> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): No ... not you. 

Strange Man(None): Oh! 

<Direction: he goes back in again> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Just mind your language... 

<Direction: Ralph knock a leg off the table. It collapses entirely.> 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Oh, sorry, mum. 

<Direction: too fat and flatulent to get up> 

Kevin Garibaldi(Terry Gilliam): I've run out of beans! 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): We was talking, we was not snogging. 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Talking about snogging, I'll bet... 

<Direction: The phone rings. Mrs Garibaldi answers it.> 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): If you must know, we was talking about Council re-housing. 

<Direction: on the phone> 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Would it mean going to live in Hollywood? 

<Direction: desperate but unable to move> 

Kevin Garibaldi(Terry Gilliam): I run out of beans! 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Where to re-house his right hand, that's what he was interested in! 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): And has Faye Dunaway definitely said yes? 

Valerie Garibaldi(Graham Chapman): He is the Chairman of the Housing sub-committee. 

<Direction: The bell rings.> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): Snogging sub-committee, more like... 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Ralph, do answer that door will you! 

Kevin Garibaldi(Terry Gilliam): Beans!! 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Shut up!! 

Ralph Garibaldi(Michael Palin): Yea, mum. 

<Direction: shouting to Ralph> 

Mr Garibaldi(Terry Jones): If it's the man from the Probbo-Rib, tell him it's in the bed. 

<Direction: Ralph gets up. As he goes he knocks the leg off the old-fashioned gas cooker. It falls to one side bringing down shelves next to it, plates, crockery and a section of the wall revealing the hallway the other side. roaring> 

Kevin Garibaldi(Terry Gilliam): Beans! Beans! 

Mrs Garibaldi(Eric Idle): Shut up! 

<Direction: A man in a Tarzan outfit, except with a postman's hat and a little mailbag, swings in on a liana shouting a jungle yell. Postman-a-a-n!! A gong sounds. They all stop acting. Cut to stock film of ladies applauding. Pull out from this stock film to see that it is on a screen in a presentation studio. A glittery compÃ¨re is also applauding sycophantically at his desk, about which is the glittery slogan 'Most Awful Family in Britain, 1974. Sponsored by Heart Attacko Margarine'.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): A very good try there, by the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor... 

<Direction: Pull out further to pick up a panel of three distinguished rather academic looking people.> 

Professor(Eric Idle): Well, I can't make up my mind about this family... I don't think there was the sustained awfulness that we really need. I mean, the father was appalling... 

<Direction: Two other members of the panel nod vigorous agreement.> 

Lady Organs(Terry Jones): Appalling... yes .... 

Professor(Eric Idle): He was dirty, smelly and distasteful ... and I liked him very much ... but... 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Lady Organs? 

Lady Organs(Terry Jones): Well ... they were an unpleasant family certainly, but I don't think we had enough of the really gross awfulness that we're looking for... 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well, harsh words there for the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire, at present holders of the East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. Well with the scores all in from the judges, the Garibaldis are number three ... and a surprise number two ... the Fanshaw-Chumleighs of Berkshire... 

<Direction: he turns to the screen A very elegant breakfast table in beautifully tasteful surroundings. Four upper-class folk - two woman (Michael and Graham) and two men (Eric and Terry J) - are talking most incredibly loudly at each other, with quite appalling accents. An appalling din altogether. They talk just about at the same time as each other.> 

First Person(Eric Idle): What a super meal. 

Second Person(Michael Palin): Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming down from Eton to help daddy count money. 

Third Person(Terry Jones): How absolutely super. 

Fourth Person(Graham Chapman): My man at Poirer's says I could have my whole body lifted for Â£5,500 

First Person(Eric Idle): How super... 

<Direction: etc. Cut back to the panel nodding thoughfully.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well, some of the wonderful behaviour that made the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. But the winners, by a clear ten point margin, are once again the awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show you some of the performance that won them an award, but I assure you it was of the very highest standard, was it not, Lady Organs? 

Lady Organs(Terry Jones): Oh, yes, superb ... Mr Jodrell - you know, the old grandfather, who licks the ... 

<Direction: hurriedly> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Yes, yes... 

Lady Organs(Terry Jones): He's superb. His gobbing is consistent and accurate. His son is a dirty foul little creature, and those frightful scabs which Mrs Jodrell licks off the cat are... 

<Direction: during this speech we cut to the same image on a TV screen> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well, thank you very much, Lady Organs ... and from all of us all, well done to the Jodrells ... and to all of you, not forgetting those of you who may be halfway in between, without whom, of course, and not forgetting who made it all possible, when, and we'll be back, until then and so it's goodnight from me and here's wishing you a safe journey home, thank you for watching this show, don't forget it was all great fun, I've enjoyed it, and I hope you watching at home have enjoyed it too. 

<Direction: He is switched off, and fades into a dot. Pull back to reveal that the TV which has just been switched off is in a dirty old sitting room in which all the characters are really unpleaant pepperpots. They are dressed more or less identically, except that son has a school cap and a blazer over his pepperpot gear. He has a satchel and National Health glasses. The father has moustache and glasses and a Fair-Isle jersey.> 

Mother(Eric Idle): The Jodrells win every bloody year... makes you vomit ... dad? 

Dad(Terry Jones): Yes? 

Mother(Eric Idle): Get your stinking feet off the bread. 

Dad(Terry Jones): I'm only wiping the cat's do's off. 

Son(Terry Gilliam): Mum? 

Mother(Eric Idle): Shut yet face, Douglas. 

Son(Terry Gilliam): I wanted some corn-plasters. 

Mother(Eric Idle): Shut up and eat what you got. 

<Direction: A cat set into the wall, i.e. a glove puppet, screeches as if someone had pulled its tail outside.> 

Dad(Terry Jones): Some fat bastard at the door! 

<Direction: to the cat she slaps it; it expires She takes a couple of milk bottles out. Standing on the doorstep is a man with a Nordic accent in female national costume. He has a tray labeled 'Icelandic Honey Week'> 

Man(Graham Chapman): A strong hive of bees contains approximately 75,000 bees. Each honey bee must make 154 trips to collect one teaspoon of honey. Hello, sir. 

Dad(Terry Jones): What do you want? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Would you like to buy some of our honey, sir? 

Mother(Eric Idle): What you doing in here? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Which would you like, the Californian Orange Blossom, the Mexican, the New Zealand, or the Scottish Heather? 

Mother(Eric Idle): He can't eat honey. It makes him go plop plops. 

Man(Graham Chapman): Come on, please try some. 

Dad(Terry Jones): All right I'll have some Icelandic Honey. 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, there is no such thing. 

Dad(Terry Jones): You mean you don't make any honey at all? 

Man(Graham Chapman): No, no, we must import it all. Every bally drop. We are a gloomy people. It's so crikey cold and dark up there, and only fish to eat. Fish and imported honey. Oh strewth! 

Mother(Eric Idle): Well why do you have a week? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Listen Buster! In Reykyavik it is dark for eight months of the year, and it's cold enough to freeze your wrists off and there's only golly fish to eat. Administrative errors are bound to occur in enormous quantities. Look at this - it's all a mistake. It's a real pain in the sphincter! Icelandic Honey Week? My Life! 

Mother(Eric Idle): Well why do you come in here trying to flog the stuff, then? 

Man(Graham Chapman): Listen Cowboy. I got a job to do. It's a stupid, pointless job but at least it keeps me away from Iceland, all right? The leg of the worker bee has... 

<Direction: They slam the door on him. Someone rather like Jeremy Thorpe looks round the door and waves as they do so. Animated titles. Then cut to a drawing of Indians attacking a fort. Music: 'The Big Country' theme. and superimposed roller caption: 'IN THE SPRING OF 1863 THE COMANCHES RALLIED UNDER THEIR WARRIOR LEADER CONCHITO IN A FINAL DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THE WHITE MAN FROM THE RICH HUNTING LANDS OF THEIR ANCESTORS. THE US CAVALRY WERE DRAWN UP AT FORT WORTH, AND THE SCENE WAS SET FOR THE FINAL ALL OUT ONSLAUGHT THAT COULD SET THE NEW TERRITORIES ABLAZE' Cut to a doctor's surgery. It has a wall shrine with a photo of Christiaan Barnard with flowers and candles in front of it. The doctor is talking to an embarrassed-looking man.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Well, Mr Cotton, you have what we in the medical profession call a naughty complaint. My advice to you is to put this paper bag over your head - it has little holes there for your eyes, you see - and to ring this bell, and to take this card along to your hospital. 

<Direction: he hands him card three feet long which reads 'For Special Treatment' the man hands him over wad of fivers the man gets up to go he picks up big text book entitled 'Medical Practice' and flicks through the pages> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Hmm.,. hmm ... Hippocratic oath ... it's not in there ... jolly good. Very useful. Next! 

<Direction: An out-of-vision scream. A man staggers in clutching his bleeding stomach. Lots of blood pours out of him throughout the scene.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Ah, yes you must be Mr Williams. 

<Direction: obviously fatally wounded> 

Williams(Terry Jones): Y... yes... 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Well, do take a seat. What seems to be the trouble? 

Williams(Terry Jones): I've... I've just been stabbed by your nurse... 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Oh dear.... well I'd probably better have a look at you then. Could you fill in this form first? 

<Direction: he hands him a form> 

Williams(Terry Jones): She just stabbed me... 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Yes. She's an unpredictable sort. Look, you seem to be bleeding rather badly. I think you'd better hurry up and fill in that form. 

Williams(Terry Jones): Ahhh ... couldn't ... I ... do ... it ... later, doctor! 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): No, no. You'd have bled to death by then. Can you hold a pen? 

Williams(Terry Jones): I'll try. 

<Direction: With great effort he releases one of his hands from his bleeding stomach.> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Yes, it's a hell of a nuisance all this damn paperwork, really it is... 

<Direction: he gets up and strolls around fairly unconcerned> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): it's a real nightmare, this damned paperwork. It really is a hell of a nuisance. Something ought to be done about it. 

Williams(Terry Jones): Do I have to answer all the questions, doctor? 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): No, no, no, just fill in as many as you can - no need to go into too much detail. I don't know why we bother with it all, really, it's such a nuisance. Well let's see how you've done, then... 

<Direction: Williams half collapses> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Oh dear oh dear... that's not very good, is it. Look, surely you knew number four! 

Williams(Terry Jones): No ... I didn't... 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): It's from 'The Merchant of Venice' - even I know that! 

<Direction: bleeding profusely> 

Williams(Terry Jones): It's going on the carpet, doctor. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Oh don't worry about that! Look at this - number six - the Treaty of Versailles, Didn't you know that? Oh, my God. 

Williams(Terry Jones): Ahgg... aghhh. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): And number nine - Emerson Fittipaldi! 

<Direction: gives Williams a look> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Virginia Wade? You must be mad! 

<Direction: The nurse enters with a smoking revolver.> 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): Oh doctor, I've just shot another patient. I don't think there's any point in your seeing him. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): You didn't 

Doctor(None): kill 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): him, did you? 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): 'Fraid so. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): You mustn't 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): them, nurse. 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): Oh, I'm sorry doctor. It was just on the spur of the moment. Rather silly really. 

<Direction: She exits, taking a sword from the wall. Through the next bit of the scene we hear screams off.> 

Williams(Terry Jones): I'm sorry about the carpet, doctor. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Mr Williams, I'm afraid I can't give you any marks, so I won't be able to recommend you for hospital. Tell you what - I'll stop the bleeding - but strictly speaking I shouldn't even do that on marks like these... 

<Direction: The nurse enters covered in blood.> 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): There are no more patients now, doctor. 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Oh well, let's go and have lunch, then. 

Nurse(Carol Cleveland): What about... er... 

<Direction: she points to Williams who is lying on the floor gurgling by this time> 

Doctor(Graham Chapman): Ah yes - look, Mr Williams we're just popping out for a bite of lunch while we've got a spare moment, you know. Look, have another bash at the form... and if at least you can answer the question on history right, then we may be able to give you some morphine or something like that, OK? 

Williams(Terry Jones): Thank you, doctor, thank you. 

<Direction: Cut to a large country house sitting more, dominated by large grinning portrait of Jeremy Thorpe. A bishop is sitting at a desk, typing. A brigadier in full military uniform just to below the chest, then a patch of bare midriff, with belly button showing, then a lavender tutu, incredibly hairy leg, thick army socks and high heels, is dictating.> 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Dear Sir, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms. Yours sincerely, Brigadier N. F. Marwood-Git (retired). Read that back, will you, Brian. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): And when he had built up Cedron, he sent Horsemen there, and an host of footmen to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the King commanded them... 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Good! Pop it in an envelope and bung it off! It's no good bottling these things up, Brian. If you feel them you must say them or you'll just go mad... 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Oh yes indeed ... as the book of Maccabee said ... Ye as the flea is like unto an oxen, so is the privet hedge liken unto a botanist black in thy sight, O Lord! 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Quite... Look why don't you just nip out for lunch, Brian... 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Yea ... as Raymond Chandler said, it was one of those days when Los Angeles felt like a rock-hard fig. 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Brian, let's stop this pretending, shall we. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Oh... ye... as Dirk Bogarde said in his autobiography... 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Brian... let's stop all this futile pretence... I've... I've always been moderately fond of you... 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Well to be quite frank, Brigadier ... one can't walk so closely with a chap like you for... for so long without... feeling something deep down inside, even if it isn't anything... anything ... very much. 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Well, splendid... Brian... er... well I don't suppose there's much we can do, really. 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Not on television ... no... 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): No... they ... they are a lot more permissive these days than they used to be... 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Ah yes... but not with this sort of thing... 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): No ... I suppose they've ... got to draw the line somewhere... 

Bishop(Michael Palin): Yes... 

Brigadier(Eric Idle): Well take a letter, Brian. Dear Sir, I wish to protest... 

<Direction: Cut to an animation sketch. and CAPTION: 'THERE NOW FOLLOWS AN APPEAL ON BEHALF OF EXTREMELY RICH PEOPLE WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM' at a large leather-topped desk with an elaborate table lamp cut to a rich young yachting type surrounded by girls in bikinis cut to a rich woman loading her chauffeur with all kinds of expensive parcels cut to a still of Centre Point> 

Sir Pratt(Graham Chapman): I know it's only human to say, 'Oh this will never happen to me', and of course, it won't. I'm asking you, please, please, send no contributions, however large, to me. 

<Direction: We see the last bit on a TV in Mrs What- a- long- name- this- is- hardly- worth- typing- but- never- mind- it- doesn't- come- up- again's living- room. Ding-dong of doorbell. A cupboard door opens, and the middle-aged man we saw in first scene comes out. He has no iguana on his shoulder.> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): All right, I'll go. 

TV Voice(Michael Palin): There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Par... 

<Direction: She turns it off. The TV set just folds up as if empty and collapses on to the floor. Dust rises. She goes into the hallway to the front door (singing 'Anything Goes' by the other Cole Porter to herself) and opens it. A man with a briefcase stands there.> 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Hello, madam... 

<Direction: comes in> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Ah hello... you must have come about... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Finishing the sentences, yes. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Oh... well... perhaps you'd like to... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Come through this way... certainly... 

<Direction: they go through into the sitting room> 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Oh, nice place you've got here. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Yes ... well ... er... we... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Like it? 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Yes ... yes we certainly... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Do... Good! Now then... when did you first start... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): ... finding it difficult to... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Finish sentences... yes. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Well it's not me, it's my... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Husband? 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Yes. He... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Never lets you finish what you've started. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Quite. I'm beginning to feel... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): That you'll never finish a sentence again as long as you live. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Exact... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): ly. It must be awful. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): It's driving me... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): To drink? 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): No, rou... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): nd the be... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): en... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): d... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Yes... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): May I... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Take a seat... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Thank you. 

<Direction: he sits> 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): You see, our method is to reassure the patient by recreating normal... er... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Conditions? 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Yes. Then we try to get them in a position where they suddenly find that they're completing other people's sentences... 

<Direction: with self-wonder> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Themselves! 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Spot on Mrs... 

<Direction: hesitantly> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Smith? 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Good! Well, try not to overdo it to... 

<Direction: with growing confidence> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Begin with... ? 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Good. Just keep it to one or two... 

<Direction: faster> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Words .... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): To start off with, otherwise you may find that you're... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Taking on too long a sentence and getting completely ... er... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Stuck. Good. Yes. Well that's about it... 

<Direction: completely confident now> 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): for now, so... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Thanks very much for calling. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Not at all. 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): And, er... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Just like to say 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Thank you very much for coming along. 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Not at all 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): And good... 

Mrs Long Name(Terry Jones): Bye, Mr... 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Vernon. 

<Direction: Mrs Long Name leaves. Mr Vernon shuts the door. A girl's voice comes from sitting room.> 

Girl's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Carl? 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Yes, dear? 

Girl's Voice(Carol Cleveland): I've just had another baby. 

Mr Vernon(Eric Idle): Oh, no! How many's that now? 

Girl's Voice(Carol Cleveland): Twelve since lunch... Oh! There's another one! 

<Direction: Cut to exterior of Mrs Long Name's house. She comes out and sets off purposefully up the road, passing four pepperpot nannies digging up the road. They are wearing the usual slippers, paisley dresses and knotted handkerchief. One wears a helmet. One works a pneumatic drill. She is stripped to the waist wearing a big pink bra. Behind, heroic shots of Mrs Long Name walking out of town, through suburbs, into neat country, then into wilder country. She finally stops in close up, and looks up with inspiration in her eyes. Cut to a linkman standing before Stonehenge.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): This is Stonehenge ... and it's from here we go to Africa. 

<Direction: Jeremy Thorpe appears at the edge of shot and waves. Cut to an as overgrown, jungleoid location as Torquay can provide. A very big thick tree in the foreground. David Attenborough pushes through jungle towards camera. He has damp sweat patches under his arms which grow perceptibly during the scene. He has two African guides in the background both with saxophones round their neck. slapping the side of a tree a native whispers in his ear> 

Attenborough(Michael Palin): Oh, super ... well, I've just been told that this is not in fact the legendary walking tree of Dahomey, this is one of Africa's many stationary trees, Arborus Barnbet Gaseoignus. In fact we've just missed the walking tree... it left here at eight o'clock this morning... was heading off in that direction... so we'll see if we can go and catch it up. Come on boys. 

<Direction: They move off. At this point we notice that there are two other saxophone-wearing natives, a trumpeter, a trombonist, a double bassist, a guitarist, and finally a man with a drum kit tied to his back. Mix through to them on the move in another pan of the jungle. Sweat is now spraying out from under Attenborough's armpits as if from a watering can.> 

Attenborough(Michael Palin): Well, we're still keeping up with it, but it's setting a furious pace. Early this morning we thought we'd spotted it, but it turned out to be an Angolan sauntering tree, Amazellus Robin Ray, out walking with a Gambian Sidling Bush... 

<Direction: Jeremy Thorpe leans in the background and waves to camera Rupert the bearer points excitedly they move off, by this time waterspray is gushing out from all over his chest> 

Attenborough(Michael Palin): But, what Rupert had in fact discovered was something very different... 

<Direction: He stops him, they kneel down. Cut to their eyeline. In the distance, amongst low bushes and thick undergrowth, six Africans dressed immaculately in cricket gear having a game of cricket. Cut to Attenborough, Rupert and one other bearer watching. Attenborough is looking down at something he is holding. The other two are gazing wide-eyed at the cricketers.> 

Attenborough(Michael Palin): The Turkish Little Rude Plant. 

<Direction: he holds up, carefully and wondrously, a plant which has green outer leaves splayed back to reveal a small, accurately sculpted bum Rupert nudges him and points excitedly at the batsmen Attenborough points, apparently at the batsmen, but he has clearly got it wrong again Rupert nudges him again Cut to an animated professor.> 

Voice(Michael Palin): No, what they had come across was a tribe lost to man since time immemorial... the legendary Batsmen of the Kalahari... 

<Direction: cut to a shot of natives playing cricket> 

Voice Over(Terry Jones): Primitive customs still survive here as if the march of time had passed them by. But for all the mumbo-jumbo and superstition, the Batsmen of the Kalahari are formidable fighters, as we can see on this rare footage of them in action against Warwickshire. 

<Direction: Cut to a big county ground pavilion in mid-shot. We zoom in on the commentator on a balcony.> 

Commentator(Michael Palin): Warwickshire had dismissed the Kalahari Batsmen for 140, and then it was their turn to face this extraordinary Kalahari attack. Pratt was the first to go, but Pratt and Pratt put on a second wicket stand of nought, which was broken by Odinga in his most hostile mood. 

<Direction: A compilation of the day's play. Natives in normal cricket gear. Pratt at crease as per usual cricket coverage. Cut to a low shot of the bowler thundering up towards the wicket. Cut away to the batsman preparing to take the shot. Cut back to the bowler. As he reaches the crease he produces a spear and raises it to shoulder height and hurls it. Cut to batsman who is hit full in the stomach. His bat dislodges the bails. There is a 'howzat' from all the native fielders. He makes an annoyed gesture as if he were Colin Cowdrey caught clean bowled, and sinks to the ground. CAPTION: 'B. RATT'> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Thats B. Pratt, hit wicket - 0. But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in and took the score to a half... 

<Direction: cut to the new batting partnership; B. Pratt's body is still on the ground Z. Pratt reaching the pavilion, running with a hail of spears and arrows coming after him cut to M.J.K. Pratt coming out pulling on gloves etc. he reaches the crease and takes guard, the bowler bowls a huge spear sticks right through the lower part of his leg; they appeal and he turns and limps manfully off> 

None(None): CAPTION: 'M.J.K. PRATT' 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): Typical of Umbonga's hostile opening spell was his dismissal of V.E. Pratt, who offered no resistance to this delivery... 

<Direction: cut to native bowler bowling a machete; it hits the ground and does a leg spin up, slicing off the batsman's head as he waves his bat> 

Voice Over(Michael Palin): ... and he was caught behind. 

<Direction: The batsman's severed head lands in the wicket keeper's gloves. He throws it in the air with a flourish. CAPTION: 'V.E. PRATT' Jeremy Thorpe appears and waves. Cut to the presenter from 'World' s Most Awful Family 1974'.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): But by lunch the situation had changed dramatically. 

<Direction: and CAPTION: 'C.U. PRATT KILLED OUTRIGHT, BOWLED ODINGA - 0. P.B.T.R. PRATT LEGS OFF BEFORE WICKET, BOWLED ODINGA - 0. B.B.C.T.V. PRATT ASSEGAI UP JACKSEY, BOWLED UNBOKO - 0. Z. PRATT MACHETE BEFORE WICKET, 'BOWLED UMBONGA - 0. M.J.K. PRATT STUMP THROUGH HEAD, BOWLED UMBONGA - 0. V.E. PRATT RAN AWAY - 0. P.D.A. PRATT RETIRED HURT - 0. W.G. PRATT RETIRED VERY HURT - 0. PRATT DIED OF FRIGHT, BOWLED ODINGA - 0. Y.E.T.A.N.O.T.H.E.R. PRATT NOT OUT BUT DREADFULLY HURT- 139.' Cut back to the presenter. Behind him the 'Worlds Most Awful Family' sign is crossed out and replaced with 'Sport'.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): And so with the tension colossal as we come up to the last ball ... that's all from us. 

<Direction: Roll credits on black background. The first part of the signature tune is played very hesitantly on guitar.

Behind the newsreader several men including Jeremy Thorpe are drinking and celebrating. A woman is dancing on the table.> 

Newsreader(Eric Idle): Good evening. Over 400,000 million pounds were wiped off the value of shares this afternoon, when someone in the Stock Exchange coughed. Sport: capital punishment is to be re-introduced in the first and second division. Any player found tackling from behind or controlling the ball with the lower part of the arm will be hanged. But the electric chair remains the standard punishment for threatening the goalie. Referee's chairman, Len Goebbels said 'at last the referee has been given teeth'. Finally, politics: the latest opinion poll published today shows Labour ahead with 40%, the AA second with 38% and not surprisingly Kentucky Fried Chicken running the Liberals a very close third. And now back to me. Hello. And now it's time to go over to Hugh Delaney in Paignton. 

<Direction: Cut to the linkman on the pier at Paignton. A smallish crowd is gathered behind him including Jerermy Thorpe who waves at the camera from the back.> 

Linkman(Michael Palin): Hello and welcome to Paignton, because it's from Paignton that we take you straight back to the studio. 

<Direction: Cut to a man in swimming trunks and a snorkel pushed back on his head standing in the studio holding a stuffed polecat on a pole.> 

Man(Graham Chapman): Hello. And it's from here we go over there. 

<Direction: Cut to the 'Most Awful Family' presenter.> 

Presenter(Michael Palin): Well we're already here so let's go over there. 

<Direction: Cut back to the newsreader.> 

Newsreader(Eric Idle): Welcome back. And now it's time for part eight of our series about the life and work of Ursula Hifier, the Surrey housewife who revolutionized British beekeeping in the nineteen-thirties. 

<Direction: and CAPTION: 'THAT WAS A PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST ON BEHALF OF THE LIBERAL PARTY' His voice breaks up with giggles. Fade to blackout. The end.
